<h2>Project 1 <br>
CS 371R: Information Retrieval and Web Search <br>
Adding Common Phrases to Vector-Space Retrieval </h2> <br>
Due: Sept. 26, 2013
</center>
<br>
<h3> Existing System </h3> 

As discussed in class, a basic system for vector-space retrieval (VSR) is
available in <code> /u/mooney/ir-code/ir/vsr/</code>.  See the <a
href="../doc/ir/vsr/package-summary.html">Javadoc </a> for this system.  Use
the <a href="../doc/ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.html#main(java.lang.String[])"> main
method </a> for <a href="../doc/ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.html"> InvertedIndex</a>
to index a set of documents and then process queries.

<p> You can use the web pages in <code>
/u/mooney/ir-code/corpora/yahoo-science/</code> as a set of test documents.
This corpus contains 900 pages, 300 random samples each from the Yahoo indices
for <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Science/Biology/"> biology</a>, <a
href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Science/Physics/"> physics</a>, and <a
href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Science/Chemistry/"> chemistry</a>.

See the <a href="sample-trace.txt">sample trace</a> of using the system.

<h3>Problem</h3>

One of the problems with VSR is that is does not handle multi-word phrases
well.  With a bag-of-words model, only individual words matter, regardless of
their position and context. Therefore, queries that use specific phrases whose
individual words do not adequately capture the meaning of the overall phrase,
are not handled well.

<p>
For example, in the <a href="sample-trace.txt">sample trace</a>, for the query
"cold fusion", the first two results contain the phrase but results 3 thru 5
do not, they do not even contain the word "cold". For the query "quantum
mechanics", the 1st result contains the phrase but the 2nd result is about
fluid mechanics and does not even contain the word "quantum," while the 3rd and
4th results are about quantum computing and do not contain the word
"mechanics". For the query "chemical physics" the 1st result is relevant but
the 2nd result only has "physics", the 3rd just "chemical", the 4th thru 6th
just "physics".  In some situations, cosine similarity can prefer documents
that contain a high density of some of the query words at the expense of
completely ignoring other query words.  In addition, cosine similarity never
considers multi-word phrases or the proximity or ordering of words.

<p>
Appropriate retrieval for many such queries can be aided by noticing that
certain phrases such as "cold fusion," "quantum mechanics," and "chemical
physics" are important as multi-word phrases and are not well represented by a
bag of words.

<h3>You Fix It</h3>

Your task is to change the existing VSR code to first find common two-word
phrases that appear in a document corpus, recognize occurrences of these
phrases in documents, index these documents using the entire phrase,
and finally recognize these phrases in queries and use them in retrieval.
Your approach should be general-purpose and should produce better 
results for the examples in the <a href="sample-trace.txt">sample trace</a>.

<p>
A simple statistical approach to discovering useful phrases is to simply look
for frequently occuring sequences of words.  In a first pass through the
corpus, your system should find all two-word phrases in the corpus (so called
"bigrams") and determine the frequency of each bigram across the entire corpus.
Consider bigrams as two indexed tokens produced in sequence by the current
Document token generator, therefore, they do not include stop words.  After
finding all bigrams, your program should determine the set of most frequent
bigrams and store them as known phrases.  Your system should have a parameter,
called <code>maxPhrases</code>, that determines the maximum number of phrases
to be remembered (which should default to a value of 1,000).  You may find the
Java sorting methods <code>Arrays.sort</code> or <code>Collections.sort</code>
useful.

<p>
Then, when producing the vector representations of documents and queries, it
should notice instances of the known phrases (two tokens generated in order),
and create a single token for the entire phrase but <strong>not</strong> tokens
for the individual words.  For example, the query "cold fusion" should
result in a vector containing a single phrasal token "cold fusion" that
does <strong>not</strong> include the individual tokens "cold" and
"fusion".

<p>
Here is a <a href="sample-soln-trace.txt">sample solution trace</a> produced by
my solution to this problem.  After the first pass through the corpus, the
system prints out the 1,000 most-common phrases with their frequency.  Notice
that, although, HTMLFileDocument does its best to parse the HTML and remove
formatting commands, a number of the most-common phrases are actually HTML
commands that are still indexed.  You can verify that all of the retrieved
documents now contain the complete two-word query phrases.  Replicating the
minute details of this trace is not important, but the trace for your system
should be similar and only retrieve documents that contain these complete
common phrases.  Your solution should be a general purpose phrase-indexer and
not just a hack that works with these specific queries.

<p>
Implement your new version as a specialized class of <code>InvertedIndex</code>
called <code>InvertedPhraseIndex</code> that accepts the same command line
options as <code>InvertedIndex</code>.  You may also need to add methods to other
classes.  In particular, my solution added methods to at least
<code>Document</code> and <code>HashMapVector</code>.

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>
In submitting your solution, follow the general course instructions on
<a href="../proj-submit-info.html">submitting projects</a> on the course homepage.
<p>
Along with that, follow these specific instructions for Project 1:

<ul>
<li> For this project, submit a directory called "proj1", which should
contain:

<ol>
<li> <i>REPORT.* file</i>:       writeup in text or html or ps or pdf
<li> <i>soln-trace</i>:          trace file of program execution
<li> <i>ir directory</i>:        should contain /vsr subfolder with all the classes
that you have made changes to. Submit <b>both</b> the .java and the 
				.class files.
</ol>
<li> <b> It is important to submit the correct directory structure!</b>.  Executing
"turnin -list jiho cs371r-proj1" should produce output similar to the following (it is
important that proj1 is the top-level directory, with other files contained in it as shown).
