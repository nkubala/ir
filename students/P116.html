This page serves as the syllabus for this course.<br>
The course textbook is 
<a href="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073383090/information_center_view0/">Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications</a><br>
By Kenneth H. Rosen<br>
Published by <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/">McGraw Hill.</a><br>
<b>We will use the 7th edition.  Problems are different in previous
editions and online editions.  You need the 7th edition.</b>
<p>

Selected readings and exercises from this text will be assigned.<br>

<p>

This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and
homework server system maintained by the College of Natural
Sciences. This homework service will require a $25 charge per student
for its use, which goes toward the maintenance and operation of the
resource. Please go to 
<a href="http://quest.cns.utexas.edu">http://quest.cns.utexas.edu</a>
to log in to the
Quest system for this class. After the 12th day of class, when you log
into Quest you will be asked to pay via credit card on a secure payment
site.  You have the option to wait up to 30 days to pay while still
continuing to use Quest for your assignments. If you are taking more
than one course using Quest, you will not be charged more than
$50/semester. Quest provides mandatory instructional material for this
course, just as is your textbook, etc. For payment questions, email
<a href="mailto:quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu">quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu</a>.

<h2> Assignments </h2>

<p>
Assignments will be updated on the
<a href="assignments/index.html">assignments page</a>. 
Before class you will often be required to complete one or more modules on
<a href="https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/">Quest</a>. Each module consists of
several videos you will need to watch, followed by multiple choice quizzes designed
to test your comprehension of the videos. 
<!--
Log in now and make sure you can
access the class modules. You will also be required to pay a small fee later in the semester
to maintain your Quest access: be sure to do this in a timely manner to assure that you do not
miss any deadlines for completing Quest modules.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Objectives</A>
</H2>

The objective of this class is to introduce incoming honors students
to the fundamentals of discrete mathematics as used in the field of
computer science.  The material will be presented in such a way as to
be interesting and appreciated both by students who have a natural
affinity for the beauty of abstract reasoning, and by students who are
more interested in its practical implications.  All students who
successfully complete the class will be able to generate rigorous, and
ideally succinct and elegant, mathematical proofs.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Content</A>
</H2>

The course is designed to cover all of the topics covered by the
non-honors version of the course (311), but in greater depth.  Such
topics include:

<UL>
<LI>Satisfiability, Predicates, and Quantifiers
</LI>
<LI>Proof Techniques 
</LI>
<LI>Graph Theory, including graph coloring
</LI>
<LI>Set theory
</LI>
<LI>Recurrences
</LI>
<LI>Big-O notation
</LI>
</UL>

More advanced topics, such as countability and elements of number
theory will be introduced as time permits and depending on the level
and interest of the students in the class.

<P>


<H2><A NAME="SECTION00090000000000000000">
Course Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Pre-class questions (5%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD> Before most classes, you will be asked to view a video or read
some material in the textbook, and answer questions pertaining to the
material. Answers will be due by 8pm the night before class.  

<!--
Responses received
between then and 9am on the class day will be deducted 10%.  Responses
received between then and 11am the following class day will be
deducted 20%.  Responses received after that will be deducted 40%
points.
-->
<P>
These deadlines are designed both to encourage you to do the readings/watch the videos
before class and also to allow us to incorporate some of your
responses into the class discussions.

<P>
<DT><STRONG> Class participation (15%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
Students are expected to be present and actively engaged in every
class and in every assigned discussion session.  Some pop quizzes may
be given and incorporated into this component of the grade.  
</DD><p>

<P>
<DT><STRONG> Missed Quizzes:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
There are three "time frames" in the semester: everything before Test 1, material between Tests 1 and 2, and everything
after Test 2 but before the final. The lowest Quiz grade for each of these time periods will have its grade replaced
by the grade received on the next Test, if the Test grade is higher. Therefore, a single missed Quiz per time period should
not hurt your grade, but repeatedly missed Quizzes will. Naturally, you have to perform well on the Tests as well.
</DD><p>

<DT><STRONG> Homework (20%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
At least five written homework sets will be assigned.  You may work in
groups of up to three, but you must write up the solutions to the
homeworks yourself, and you must explicitly acknowledge any help given or received (tell us with whom you worked). 
<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Midterms (30%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Two midterm exams will be administered.
</DD<p>
</DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>Final (30%):</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A final exam will be given during the regular final exam period
on: 
<b>Saturday, December 14th, 7pm-10pm in <A
href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/jgb.html">JGB
2.216</A></b>.
</DD>
<p>


<H2><A NAME="SECTION000100000000000000000">
Extension Policy</A>
</H2>

<P> If you turn in your assignment late, expect points to be deducted.
No exceptions will be made for the pre-class questions (subject to the
``notice about missed work due to religious holy days'' below).  For
other assignments, extensions will be considered on a case-by-case
basis, but in most cases they will not be granted.  The greater the
advance notice of a need for an extension, the greater the likelihood
of leniency.

<P> 
<!--For the penalties on responses to the pre-class questions see
above (under course requirements).  
-->
For homework assignments, by
default, 10% will be deducted for lateness, plus an
additional 1% for every 24-hour period beyond 2 that the
assignment is late.  For example, an assignment due at 9:30am on
Tuesday will have 10% deducted if it is turned in late but before
9:30am on Thursday.  It will have 11% deducted if it is turned
in by 9:30am Friday, etc.

<P> This extension policy is, by all accounts, quite lenient.  The
primary objective is to incentivize students to keep pace with the
class.  The secondary objective is to incentivize students who have
missed an assignment, for whatever reason, to nonetheless learn the
material.  If the leniency of the policy is seen to be abused by the
students, it will be revised towards being more penal.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000110000000000000000">
Academic Dishonesty Policy</A>
</H2>

<P> You are encouraged to discuss the concepts with classmates, but
all written work must be your own.  All work
ideas, quotes, and code fragments that originate from elsewhere must
be cited according to standard academic practice. Students caught
cheating will automatically fail the course.  If in doubt, look
at the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html#honesty">departmental
guidelines</a> and/or ask.
<p>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000120000000000000000">
Notice about students with disabilities</A>
</H2>

<P>
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities.  To
determine if you qualify, please contact the Dean of Students at
471-6529; 471-4641 TTY.  If they certify your needs, I will work with
you to make appropriate arrangements.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000130000000000000000">
Notice about missed work due to religious holy days</A>
</H2>

<P>
A student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project
due to the observance of a religious holy day will be given an
opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after
the absence, provided that he or she has properly notified the
instructor.  It is the policy of the University of Texas at Austin
that the student must notify the instructor at least fourteen days
prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to
observe a religious holy day.  For religious holy days that fall
within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given
on the first day of the semester.  The student will not be penalized
for these excused absences, but the instructor may appropriately
respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed
assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the excused
absence.
