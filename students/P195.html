<p><b>Grading</b> <br>
I think we all wish that we could have courses without grades. You hate
worrying
about grades. I hate having to assign grades. But grades are essential
to
insuring that your degree has the value that it deserves. So we have a
grading
system and that system has to have two essential properties: <br>
-It has to be fair to everyone in the class. <br>
-It has to be a true measure of how much each student knows about the
class
material. <br>
The system I will use in this class will assign grades as follows: <br>
Exams (Sep 28, Nov 2, final exam slot) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(all
cumulative,
20%,
20%,
35%)
<br>
Homework
assignments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;15%
<br>
Quizzes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10%<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The standard letter grade cutoffs will be applied, i.e., 90 - 100 %
is
an A, 80 - 89 % is a B, etc., with +/- used as deemed appropriate by
the instructor. It is possible that these cutoffs may be
lowered,
but don't count on it. </p>
<p>The exam dates given above are tentative and may be changed. The
midterm exams will be given in the evening on the specified date. <br>
</p>
<p>No late assignments will be accepted. Homework assignments are due
at the beginning of class on the due date. Quizzes may or may not be
announced in advance, and the lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
Because the lowest quiz grade is dropped, no late or makeup quizzes
will be given. There will be no makeup midterm exams unless it
coincides with one of your other classes, and a missed test
without a written, verifiable emergency, medical, religious, or
participation in a varsity sporting event excuse provided to the
instructor will count as a zero. Emergency excuses can be provided
after the test. All other excuses must be provided one week before the
test. With such an excuse a midterm exam grade will be replaced by
your final exam grade. With such an excuse a makeup final exam will
be given. <br>
</p>
<p>In order for this grading system to work fairly for everyone, we
need a
few additional ground rules: <br>
(1) Assigned grades are not the starting point of a negotiation. This
isn't
a weekend bazaar. Unless we have made a specific mistake in grading
your
work (i.e., you have a correct answer that was marked wrong or your
score
was added incorrectly), your grade is final. <br>
(2) If we have made a mistake, then you must submit a description of
the
problem in writing in email to the TA within one week after we return
the
graded work to the class. All evidence and supporting arguments must be
included
in this email, and the assignment, quiz or exam must be promptly
returned to the
grader. All grade disputes will result in the entire test, quiz or
assignment being regraded. Note that mistakes in grading can work
against you or
in your favor, so regrading may result in a higher or lower grade. <br>
</p>
<p>Note that none of the following grade discussions is appropriate: <br>
(1) "I know my answer was wrong, but I deserve more partial credit
points."
When we grade, we make decisions about how many points to give for
various
kinds of wrong answers. This is never a clear cut decision. The
important
thing is that we make some decision and then implement it fairly for
everyone.
It is completely unfair to come back later and give one person more
points
just because they ask. We won't do it. <br>
(2) "I don't like my final grade. It will ruin my life for the
following reason:
... Therefore you should give me a better one." Class grades reflect
only
one thing: how well you did in the class. Life circumstances just don't
play
a role here. Don't come to me with this kind of argument. <br>
(3) "I don't like my final grade. I am desperate. Isn't there some sort
of
extra credit thing I could do?" Any answer other than "No" to this
question
would be completely unfair to other students in the class unless they
were
all offered this option. That would be equivalent to saying that the
semester
isn't over and everyone can keep trying. We're not going to do this.
Final
grades are final. <br>
(4) "I don't like my final grade. Can I have an incomplete and try
again?"
There are University rules for giving incompletes. If you meet those
rules
(e.g., you had a medical problem during the semester), then, of course,
come
and tell me and ask for an incomplete. But make sure you do it as soon
as
you can. Do not wait until the semester is over. If you do not meet the
rules,
the answer is "No". <br>
(5) "I don't like my final grade. It doesn't reflect what I really
know.
I guess I didn't show what I know on the exams, but won't you give me a
chance
to convince you that I really know this stuff." Again, any answer other
than
"No" would be unfair to everyone else.<br>
</p>
<p>Some of the comments above are based on the computer science
department's <a
 href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html">code of
conduct</a>.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Study Groups</span><br>
Please organize yourselves into study groups of 3-5 students who will
meet once a week to discuss the course material. One member of each
group should email the
group members' names and your meeting location and time to your
TA by the fourth class meeting. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Academic Honesty</b> <br>
We follow the University's standard policies on academic honesty. They
will
be rigorously enforced. Cheating will result in action commensurate
with
the policies stated in the University's Manual on Academic Honesty. At
the very least cheating will lead to an automatic F in the class and a
referral of the case to the Dean of Students Office. Additional
penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the University, may
be imposed by that office. You
are
expected to do all work individually unless explicit permission for
group
work is given. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Every piece of work that you
submit with your name on it must be
yours and yours alone</span>. Students may not acquire from any source
(e.g.,
another student or an internet site) a partial or complete solution to
a problem that has been assigned. You may discuss approaches to
problems with other students, but you have <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">crossed the line into cheating</span> if
you are looking at another student's solution or solutions from any
other source. Discuss the approach,
but write up the solution on your own. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Students with Disabilities</b> <br>
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic
accomodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information,
