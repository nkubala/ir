Project 0 will <b>NOT</b> be graded, and is entirely optional.  It is just
an exercise to walk you through the trace-collection and submission
procedure. The sole purpose of Project 0 is to smooth out any glitches
with Java environment setting, trace-collecting or submitting. If you
submit Project 0 and have any problems on the way, the TA can help you with it.

<p>The TA will help people with problems regarding Project 0 until the
submission deadline. After the submission deadline for Project 0, it will be
your responsibility to make sure that you know how to:

<ol>
<li> Set up the Java environment correctly
<li> Collect traces
<li> Submit the required files
</ol>

As discussed in class, a basic system for vector-space retrieval (VSR) is
available in <code>/u/mooney/ir-code/ir/vsr/</code>.  See the <a
href="./doc/ir/vsr/package-summary.html">Javadoc </a> for this system.  Use the <a
href="./doc/ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.html#main(java.lang.String[])"> main 
method </a> for <a href="./doc/ir/vsr/InvertedIndex.html">
InvertedIndex</a> to index a set of documents and then process queries.
<p> 
You can use the web pages in
<code>/u/mooney/ir-code/corpora/yahoo-science/</code> as a set of test
documents.  This corpus contains 900 pages, 300 random samples each from the
Yahoo indices for <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Science/Biology/"> biology</a>,
<a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Science/Physics/"> physics</a>, and <a
href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Science/Chemistry/"> chemistry</a>.
<p>
See the <a href="sample-trace.txt">sample trace</a> of using the system.
Open a Firefox browser before you run the code in order to have
selected documents displayed in the browser.

<h3>Your task</h3> Setup your Java environment (see info at <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/java-info.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/java-info.html</a>)
, index the document collection at /u/mooney/ir-code/corpora/yahoo-science/,
give the queries "cold fusion" and "quantum mechanics". Collect the trace
using the "script" Unix utility. Submit the trace file using the "turnin"
command (see info at <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/proj-submit-info.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/proj-submit-info.html
</a>)<br>
