			<p style="text-align: left;">The crosscutting theme in this course is
providing
abstractions above
imperfect hardware to make it usable by programmers and users. At the
end
of the course, students should understand a set of abstractions
(concurrent
programming, virtual addressing, memory protection, caching,
transactions,
...) that are useful in many large-scale software systems not just OS
kernels.
More important than memorizing specific abstractions used in operating
systems of the past, students should understand these abstractions well
enough to synthesize their own abstractions when faced with new
problems. </p>
			<div style="text-align: left;">
				Another important goal of the course is for students to understand 
the computers they use and on which they build their applications. A 
student graduating with a CS degree should believe "there is no magic": 
they should be able to describe the chain of events that occurs when 
they hit a key and cause a letter to appear on the screen from the 
register level (or logical gate level or transistor level) to the system
 architecture level to the operating system level to the application 
level. This is philosophically important, but it is also of practical 
interest to developers who need to figure out how to make a system do 
what they want it to do.<br>

				<h2><a name="Grading"></a>Grading and
				Course Mechanics</h2>
				<p>The department's <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct/">code of conduct</a> outlines what is
expected of you  and what you can expect from classes in the CS</p>

				It is important for you to realize what grades in this class reflect and what they <i>don't</i>
 reflect. All we can grade you on is how well you demonstrate that you 
know the material this semester. We can't grade you on how much of a 
success you'll be after graduation, how 
smart/creative/persistent/self-motivated you are, or even how well 
you'll be able to apply the material in the future. And after all, it is
 what you do in the future, not what you do this semester, that's really
 important.
		    <p>That said, grades will be determined as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Homework 5%</li>
					<li>Midterm 1: 20%
					</li>
					<li>Midterm 2: 20%
					</li>
					<li>Projects: 30%
				</li>
					<li>Final 25%</li>
				</ul>

<!---				<P><I>Rather than having two midterms,
				an alternative would be to have a
				midterm (worth 25%)
				and a final (worth 35%). 
				I will take a non-binding poll in the first
				class to see if there is a strong
				preference one way or the other and 
				announce by the second class whether 
				we will do midterm 30/midterm
				30/project 40
				or midterm 25/final 35/project
				40</I></P>
--->
				

				The course will be graded on a curve, with the score-to-letter-grade
 mapping determined by the instructor based on factors such as the 
difficulty of an assignment, the types of errors people are making, etc.
 During the semester, I will give rough estimates of where grade 
cut-offs lie, but these will be deliberately somewhat vague; if knowing 
where a cut-off is within a few points will affect how you study, you're
 worrying too much about grades and not enough about the material (Plus,
 it's a really bad idea to gauge your effort by what you think you need 
to make to get a particular letter grade). I want everyone in the class 
to do well, and if everyone masters the material and gets good marks, I 
will happily abandon the curve and give "extra" A's and B's. In 
particular, I guarantee that anyone who gets a grade of 90% or more of 
the total points will get an A, anyone with 80% or more will get at 
least a B, and anyone with 70% or more of the points will get at least a
 C.
				<p>I grade on a curve rather than an absolute scale because it 
protects students from stressing out if I happen to give an overly hard 
midterm or final. The downside of grading on a curve is that it tends to
 lead students to think they are competing against each other. In 
practice, this worry is misplaced. First, I will set grade cut-offs for 
each assignment to correspond to the quality of the work and depth of 
understanding reflected by each range of scores not by the number of 
students that make each range of scores. Second, note that the impact of
 any individual score on the overall class distribution is trivial -- 
for example someone making a 10% better grade on a midterm raises the 
class semester average by .1%.</p>
				<p>Also, for this type of project students often stress about 
whether they will be penalized because their project may not be as 
elaborate as that of some of the other groups in the class. Again, this 
is not something to worry about. The project is hard enough without 
looking over your shoulder at other students. By and large, most 
students do quite well on the project -- the consequence is that the 
project has less effect than you might think on the curve. A warning, 
however: if you punt the project, you will fail the course.</p>
				<p>In some courses, the TAs and instructor have to spend a lot of 
time dealing with regrading appeals, time that would be better spent 
helping students learn the material. Absolutely come to us if we make an
 arithmetic error, but realize that a few points here and there are 
extremely unlikely to make any difference in your final grade. If you 
believe that we assigned too little credit for your work, you may submit
 your work for a regrade under the following restrictions. (1) All 
regrade requests must be submitted with a clear, written statement that 
explains why you believe the original grade was incorrect. (2) All 
requests for regrades must be submitted within 1 calendar week of when 
the graded work is returned. (3) We will regrade the <i>entire</i> exam,
 problem set, or project assignment, and if we were overly generous we 
will deduct points. Thus, you grade can go up or down on a regrade.</p>
				<p>You  are required to attend class, and you are responsible for knowing or learning  any material presented in class. If you must miss class, you are not required  to inform the instructor, but you are responsible for learning any material you  missed. The instructor posts detailed notes for each class on the course web  site, but classes are interactive, so the actual discussion may depart from the  notes. The best way to know what actually happened in a class is to be there  and participate; if you must miss a class, you should study the notes carefully  and perhaps talk to your colleagues about the technical topics discussed and  their take on what points were particularly emphasized. Although attending  class and participating in discussion is vital for learning the material and  doing well on the assignments and exams, there is no explicit or separate  &quot;attendance&quot; element used in computing your final grade.</p>
<p><b>Late policy. </b>No extensions will be given for completing 
  the programming projects, except that each team will be allowed 4 
  flexible slip days for the projects. A team may divide their slip days 
  across projects in any way they wish to extend deadlines for the 
  projects. To help the TA track your 
  slip-day status, the top of each project's README file must include the 
</p>
				<ul>
					Slip days used (this project): _______ Slip days used (total): ______
				</ul>
				<p>Slip days will be tracked at the granularity of a day; if an 
			  assignment is 1 minute late, it is one day late.</p>
			  <p>No extensions will be given for completing homeworks, and late homeworks will not be graded. Slip days may not be used for homeworks.</p>
				<p>Exemptions of the above
				  rules will be allowed in three cases:			  </p>
				<ol>
					<li type="1">Illness, which has to be documented by a doctor and approved by the university.
					</li><li type="1">Death in the immediate family.
					</li><li type="1">Accommodation for students with disabilities as prescribed by the university.<br>
				</li></ol>
	No extensions will be given for any other reason, including 
participation in the Annual Elbonian Cultural Festival, death of a 
former president, a critical job interview or business trip, or a potluck lunch for the local chapter of a 
political party (yes, we have received such requests in the past).
					<p><b>Cooperation and cheating.</b> We encourage you to discuss the
 problem sets and programming assignments with your colleagues. We 
welcome discussions of possible interpretations of questions, solution 
approaches, and points of confusion. You are also welcome to use 
existing public libraries in your programming assignments (such as 
public classes for queues, trees, etc.) You may also look at operating 
systems code for public domain software such as Linux. Such activities 
qualify under approved collaboration practices and you are welcome to 
take advantage of them. <b>You may not look at any course project material relating to any project similar to this course's class projects.</b>
 For example, you may not look at the work done by a student in past 
years' courses, and you may not look at similar course projects at other
 universities.&nbsp; If you are unsure about whether a particular source
 of external information is permitted, contact the instructor before 
looking at it.<br>
					</p>
					<p>Note that cooperation is not the same thing as cheating. The 
project assignments and exams must be the work of the student turning 
them in. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty 
are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of 
failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Because such
 dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the
 University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly 
enforced.</p>
					<p>It is generally OK to verbally discuss the concepts needed to do
 projects assignments. Three guidelines will help you keep on the right 
side of the line. </p>
					<ol>
						<li type="1">First, other than the TA and instructor, <b>it is never OK to look at the written work of another person or show another person your written work</b>
 until after all grading on an assignment is completed. This includes 
looking at paper print-outs, sketching solutions on a white board or 
napkin, or looking at a screen to help debugging. It should go without 
saying that copying other people's code or solution sets is strictly 
prohibited. 
					
						</li>
					  <li type="1">Second, while you are discussing an assignment with another student, you must not have a writing implement, keyboard, or recording device in hand. Similarly, you should not read from your own work. After discussing a
						problem with another
						student (or the TA!),
						go watch American Idol for a half hour before going back to work 
on the assignment. If you can't remember what the person said after a 
half hour, you didn't really understand it.</li><li type="1">Third, 
everyone in the class is expected to take appropriate measures for 
protecting one's work. For example, you should protect your files and 
printouts from unauthorized access. 
				
					</li></ol>
					<p>Note that these guidelines are necessarily generalizations and 
can not account for all circumstances. Intellectual dishonesty can end 
your career, and it is your responsibility to stay on the right side of 
the line. If you are not sure about something, ask.</p>
					<p><b>Midterms.</b> There will
					be two midterms. The first midterm is March 1 and the second midterm is April 14. If
					you have a  preexisting, important, and unresolvable conflict with a 
					midterm, let the instructor
					know during the <b>first two
					weeks of class</b>, and, if appropriate, we will schedule a makeup for a time <b>before</b>
 the exam is given to the rest of the class. The final will be at the 
place and time specified by the Registrar. Unless stated otherwise, both
 the midterm and final exam will be <b>closed book</b> and will cover material from lectures, readings, problem sets, and the projects. Currently, the registrar's web site, <a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/112/finals/">http://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/112/finals/</a>, indicates that the exam will be         Tuesday, May 17, 2:00-5:00 pm. This may be subject to change by the  registrar's office, which will produce a final exam schedule later this semester.</p>
					<p><b>Projects.</b> Perhaps the most valuable part of this class 
will be the programming assignments. The projects will be done in 
two-person teams. Further details about the project will be covered in 
later handouts.</p>
			  <p><b>Homework.</b> We will post a number of problem sets. In each problems set, a few problems will be marked as &quot;required turn in&quot;. You must turn in required-turn-in problems at a specified time and we will grade those. The other problems are not turned in, but you should do them to learn the material and practice for the exams.</p>
<p>Of course, the lack of an actual 
					  grade or a deadline for completing these problems may be an 
					  invitation for procrastination or even ignoring this process altogether.
					  But we trust that you will find this a useful aspect of the class and 
					  we strongly urge you to take advantage of it. To make effective use of 
					  this feature, complete the sets by the specified deadline. Delaying the 
					  problem sets with the intent of accumulating them and solving them at once before the exams is not an effective strategy.</p>
<p>Required-turn-in problems must be done individually. However-as discussed in the cooperation policy above, you may orally discuss the homework problems, your approach, difficulties, ideas, etc with anyone, but you must not look at or show any written work from/to anyone else (except the TAs or the instructor).</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><b>Accommodations for students with disabilities.</b> The 
					  University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
					  adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more 
					  information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259,
