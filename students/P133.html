<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>
This course will cover traditional material as well as recent advances in
information retrieval (IR), the study of the processing, indexing, querying,
organization, and classification of textual documents, including hypertext
documents available on the world-wide-web.  See the <a
href="syllabus.html">course syllabus</a> for further details.


<h2>Course Requirements and Grading</h2>
<p>
Periodical reading assignments from the text and recent research papers will be
given and should be read <strong>before</strong> the corresponding lecture.
Students will be held responsible for all information presented either in class
or in the reading assignments.
<p>
Class lectures will use Powerpoint presentations available on the <a href=".">
course homepage </a>.  This should allow students to focus on understanding the
material during class and reduce the need for taking notes; however, simply
reading the slides is no substitute for attending class in which additional
explanation and discussion is presented.
<p>
Prompt attendance at class is required. Attendance will be taken at the very
beginning of every class period and a student's attendance record will count as
part of the course grade. 

<h3> Programming Assignments </h3>
<p>
There will be four programming assignments throughout the semester.  These will
involve using and modifying existing Java programs for various IR and web
search tasks.  You can use your student account on the department Linux
workstations or any other Java platform available to you (however, we will only
provide support for running on departmental Linux machines).  If you are not a
CS student and need a temporary department account, apply on the web at <a
href="https://udb.cs.utexas.edu/amut/acut/">
https://udb.cs.utexas.edu/amut/acut/</a>.

<h3> Midterm Exam</h3> 
<p>
There will be a midterm exam on Oct. 17 that will cover the material in the
first half of the course.  We will review for the test the class before. A
sample former midterm is available on the course home page.

<h3> Final Exam </h3>
<p>
The final will be held Fri. Dec. 13, 2-5PM in the normal classroom.  It
will be comprehensive test covering all material presented in the course. We
will review for the final on the last class day.  A sample former final is
available on the course home page.  

<h3> Late Submission and Cheating Policies</h3>

Assignments, projects, and exams should be completed <i>independently </i>by
each student and any program code should always be appropriately commented.
Assignments should be <a href="proj-submit-info.html">
submitted electronically </a> at least 30 minutes before the
start of class on the due date.  Be sure to hand in assignments on time, late
penalties are a loss of a percentage of the original overall points for the
assignment: 1 Day: 15%, 2 Days: 40%; 3 Days: 75%; past 3 days: 100%.  A day is
a 24 hour period starting 30 minutes before the beginning of class and includes
all weekend days and holidays.
<p>

Read the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/code-conduct/"> department's
academic policy page</a>.  Students who demonstrably violate the Academic
Honesty policy will receive a failing grade in the class.  We will be using the
<a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">Moss</a> system to screen
submited programs for plagiarism.  Over the years, I unfortunately had to fail
over a dozen students for copying on programming assignments.  To avoid
problems, limit any discussion of assignments with other students to
clarification of the requirements or definitions of the problems, or to
understanding the existing programs or general course material.  Never discuss
issues directly relevant to problem solutions.

<h3> Final Grade </h3>
The final grade will be determined as follows:
<pre>
46%  Assignments
18%  Midterm
28%  Final
 8%  Attendance
