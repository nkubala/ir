<h2>How to Turn in the Programming Assignments</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
<p>Assignments
are due 11:59 PM CDT on the date listed (except for project 1).
To submit your assignments, follow this guide.</p>
<p>The basic order of things is:</p>
<ol>
<li> Transfer the files from your machine over to the Linux machines
</li>
<li> Test your code on the Linux machine
</li>
<li> Use turnin to submit your files </li>
<li> Verify that your files were correctly submitted
</li>
			</ol>
<p>It is a good idea to make a directory/folder for cs314 and a subdirectory
for each assignment.  There will be many files named <TT>Cons.java</TT>,
and having separate directories will keep the files from older assignments
from being overwritten and lost.
<PRE>
mkdir cs314                 make a directory called cs314
cd cs314                    connect (move into) that directory
mkdir asg2                  make a directory called asg2
cd asg2                     connect (move into) that directory
...                         now work on assignment 2

<h2>Transferring Files</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
<p>If
you do the assignments on the CS Linux computers, you may skip this
step; however, if you do the assignments at home, you will need to
transfer your files over to one of the Linux machines.</p>
		
<p>In order to connect to a CS linux machine, you first need the machine name.  You may find a list of machine names at <a href="http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/unixlabstatus/"><TT>http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/unixlabstatus/</TT></a>.
Find a machine that is up and, preferably, has a low number of users.
Once you select a machine, you must concatenate ".cs.utexas.edu" onto
the end of the listed machine name. For instance, if your are trying to
connect to the machine called <tt>moro</tt>, you would use <tt>moro.cs.utexas.edu</tt> as the host name.</p>
		
<p>There are many programs, which you may use to connect to the CS machines using SSH; a brief list is available at <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/faq/"><tt>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/faq/</tt></a> under <B>Unix</B>,
click on the first question, "What happened to FTP access?".
You can also use the
<tt>scp</tt> command on OS X / Linux / Cygwin.</p>
		
<p>To
connect, you will need both the host name and your user name. As
previously mentioned, the hostname will be
&lt;computer_name&gt;.cs.utexas.edu; your user name is your <em>CS account username</em>;
it is not your UT EID. If you were connecting to the Linux machines
using the Mac OSX terminal, it would look something like this:</p>

<p><tt>ssh &lt;cs_username&gt;@&lt;computer_name&gt;.cs.utexas.edu</tt></p>
		
<p> Alternatively, you can use the <tt>-l</tt> (that is a lowercase L) flag to provide your user name.  As a result, the following command is equivalent to the one above:</p>
		
<p><tt>ssh &lt;computer_name&gt;.cs.utexas.edu -l &lt;cs_username&gt;</tt></p>
		
<p>On some SSH applications you will be asked for a port number. Port 22 is the standard port, so use this value.</p>

<p>After
you successfully connect to the linux machine, it will say something
about saving a public key to the database. You want to do this so it
doesn't have to keep re-authenticating your key every time you try to
log in.</p>
		
<p>Now that you are logged in, if you
have a GUI you can transfer files over that way. By default, the
default folder that you transfer the files into will be the folder that
you start in when you log in at the command line interface. If you do
not want to use a GUI, come to office hours and I will show you how to
use <tt>scp</tt>.</p>
		
<p>Please note that when you
SSH into a machine, you are remotely using that machine; you will not
have access to your locally stored files. If you want, you can avoid
transferring files between your machine and the CS Linux machines
simply by working on them remotely using SSH.</p>

<h2>Compiling Java on the Command Line</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
<p>If
you are using Java, your program must be able to be compiled and run
from the command line. While you are free to develop using any IDE you
like, such as Eclipse, realize that for testing purposes, no particular
IDE configuration will be used or even available. Before submitting
your files, be sure that they can be compiled using <tt>javac &lt;your_files&gt;</tt> and run using <tt>java &lt;your_program&gt;</tt>.  If you are using Eclipse, generally this means that you will need to remove the package statement from your Java files.</p>
<p>For example, in project 2, your files should be compiled using the following command:</p>
<p><tt>javac Cons.java</tt></p>
<p>Your program must execute the sample main() using the following command:</p>
<p><tt>java Cons</tt></p>

<h2>Turning In Your Files</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
<p>Now
that you have successfully transferred your files and (presumably)
tested them to make sure that (1) they work as expected on Linux and
(2) they are the correct version, you are ready to turn them in. Make
sure the working directory is where your source files are and type
the appropriate command, depending on your class section and the first
letter of your last name:</p>
<P>
<B>TTh 12:30 - 2:00:</B>

<UL>
<LI> <B>A-K</B> <tt>turnin --submit rezwana CS314-hw2 &lt;filenames&gt; </tt> 

<LI> <B>L-Z</B> <tt>turnin --submit muqeet CS314-hw2 &lt;filenames&gt; </tt> 
</UL>
<P>
<B>TTh 2:00 - 3:30:</B>

<UL>
<LI> <B>A-I</B> <tt>turnin --submit yunsik CS314-hw2 &lt;filenames&gt; </tt> 

<LI> <B>J-N</B> <tt>turnin --submit sccheng CS314-hw2 &lt;filenames&gt; </tt> 

<LI> <B>O-Z</B> <tt>turnin --submit maxxb CS314-hw2 &lt;filenames&gt; </tt> 
</UL>

<p>Note that the assignment names should be CS314-hw2, CS314-hw3, etc.
</p>
			
<p>As an example, the following could be used to turn in Cons.java and
the README (containing answers to questions asked in the assignment)
for assignment 2, Recursion and Lists:</p>
			
<p> <tt>turnin --submit myta CS314-hw2 Cons.java README </tt> </p>

The easy way to do it is to keep all the files for a given assignment
in a single directory; then you can simply use the <TT>*</TT> notation
to include all files (substitute the correct name of your TA):

<PRE>
cd cs314/asg2/
turnin --submit myta CS314-hw2 *
</PRE>
		</div>
		</div>

		<div class="block">
		<div class="header">
<h2>Verifying Your Submission</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
<p>It is important to check to make sure that your files were correctly
submitted. Turnin makes it very easy for you to check, so there are no
excuses for not performing this step. </p>
			
<p>To get a copy of the directory and all of the files you submitted, use the <tt>--verify</tt> option.  You use it like this (substitute the correct
name of your TA):</p>
			
<p><tt>turnin --verify myta &lt;assignment_name&gt;</tt></p>
			
<p>For example, using assignment 2, you would type:</p>
			
<p><tt>turnin --verify myta CS314-hw2</tt></p>
			
<p>Once
you have the folder containing a copy of your submitted files, double
check that they are the right versions and still compile / execute. In
previous classes, many students have mistakenly not submitted a file or
submitted an outdated version; don't let that happen to you.</p>
			
<p>Turnin
also provides you with a listing of the files submitted. It is not
quite as good as retesting the files, but it can be used to check that
all of the files you thought you submitted actually were. To get a list
of submitted files, use the <tt>--list</tt> option.  The syntax is just like <tt>--verify</tt>.</p>
			
<p>If you want more information on the turnin program itself, from within the Linux shell type:</p>

<p><tt>man turnin</tt></p>

<p>This will bring up the manual for the turnin command. To exit the manual, press the "q" button.</p>

<h2>Additional Requirements</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
<p>You
are expected to include some additional information for every
assignment: your name (important for a class of this size, so don't
omit it), any parts of the assignment you were unable to complete, and
anything else you would like to say about your work. Put this
information in a separate README file, which should be just a plain
text file (no Word files, etc.). To facilitate grading, please do not
change the names of the files or signatures of the functions given to
you. Normally, you should not have to modify anything existing; your
job is to add new stuff. The one exception is with the *.asgx.java
files. For example, you need to change Cons.asg2.java to Cons.java in
order to compile. In these cases, submit the files under the new names.
</p>
<p>Please make sure you turn in all files necessary to
run your program as an independent unit. This means that you should
even include files you have not modified from the class directory in
your submission. If you choose to program in Lisp, you should also
duplicate the test code section, which is provided to you in Java, and
include it as part of your code submission.</p>

			<h2>Advice</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
<p>Bad
things can and do happen to source code; this is just an unfortunate
fact of life in CS. We do not expect you to use a source code
management scheme, but you should be aware that things could happen if
you are coding on your laptop, etc. In order to prevent these
unfortunate circumstances from impacting you too much, consider using
turnin to keep a current copy of your work. Turnin will overwrite the
files every time you submit them, so this is one way to always keep a
version available for grading.</p>
