<br>

<br>

1. Not all problems in each homework set will be graded. We will
typically choose a subset of the assigned problems to grade. <br>


<br>


2. Your homework solutions must be legible. If your handwriting is not
legible, use a word processor to produce solutions.<br>


<br>


3. Each claim you make must follow from the hypothesis or previous
claims. <br>


<br>


4. Critique your own proofs carefully before submitting them. We are
focusing not only on writing correct proofs, but learning to recognize
when a proof is, and is not, correct. <br>


<br>


5. Pictures should not appear in your proofs. A picture can convey an
idea, but a picture is not a formal proof. <br>


<br>


6. After a homework set is handed in, you are expected to be prepared
to present your solution on the board in class. <br>

<br>

7. Homework solution sets <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must be stapled together at the top left
corner</span>. Your solutions should not folded in any way or placed in a
binder or folder. Put your name, EID and discussion section time in the
top right corner. <br>
