    <p><b>Grading</b>
      <br>
      I think we all wish that we could have courses without grades. You
      hate worrying about grades. I hate having to assign grades. But
      grades
      are essential to insuring that your degree has the value that it
      deserves.
      So we have a grading system and that system has to have two
      essential
      properties:
      <br>
      -It has to be fair to everyone in the class.
      <br>
      -It has to be a true measure of how much each student knows about
      the
      class material.
      <br>
      The system I will use in this class will assign grades as follows:
      <br>
      3 Exams (Feb 29, Apr 11, final exam
      slot)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20% each<br>
      Programming Projects&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      20%<br>
      Quizzes and Homework
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      20%<br>
    </p>
    <p>The standard letter grade cutoffs will be applied, i.e., 90 - 100
      %
      is an A, 80 - 89 % is a B, etc. These cutoffs may be changed to
      the
      benefit of the students at the instructor's discretion. The use of
      +
      and - grades may be used at the instructor's discretion as
      well; + and - grades will only possibly be used when it benefits
      the
      students. For example, if you have a 90% course average, you are
      guaranteed an A. But if you make 89%, it is possible that you
      could be
      assigned an A- or B+, rather than a B. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The exam dates given above are tentative and may be changed. The
      midterm exams will be given in the evening.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Your grade records will be maintained by your TA. If you have
      questions
      or concerns about your grade, contact your TA during lab hours or
      by
      email. <br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Homework and Programming
        Assignments</span><br>
      The due
      date
      for each programming assignment will be clearly stated. Respect
      Murphy's rule and
      plan for your bus to run late, your
      personal computer to crash the afternoon of the due date, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Read the project requirements carefully. You will lose points if
      you
      do not follow the
      instructions. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Unless otherwise noted, all projects will be equally weighted,
      and
      all quizzes will be equally weighted. Homework will typically be
      collected at the beginning of discussion or class, and the quizzes
      will
      typically be
      similar to the homework problems and in-class examples and
      exercises.
      If you have not worked the homework problems, you will not do well
      on
      the quizzes or exams.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Collaboration on Assignments</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>You are encouraged to study for exams together, and to <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">discuss</span> approaches
      to solving the programming
      assignments. See the programming project webpage for more
      information
      about project requirements. You and your project partner must
      follow
      the pair
      programming rules, which are posted on the class webpage.&nbsp;
      Project
      partners will receive the same grade for the
      assignment. </p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      Study Groups</span><br>
    Please organize yourselves into study groups of 3-6 students who
    will
    meet once a week to discuss the course material. One person in each
    group should submit the
    group members and your meeting location and time to your
    TA via email by the fourth class meeting.&nbsp;<br>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        <br>
        Exam Topics</span><br>
      Exams will cover material from lecture, discussion section,
      assignments, and assigned readings. &nbsp;Exams will be closed
      book,
      and they will not be comprehensive. Tentative exam dates are
      posted
      above, and are subject to change. <span style="font-weight:
        bold;"><br>
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        Quizzes</span><br>
      Announced and pop quizzes will be given frequently, both in
      lecture and
      discussion. Your lowest quiz
      grade will be dropped. No makeup quizzes will be given. I suggest
      that
      you plan to attend all classes and discussion sections so that you
      may
      drop a quiz you miss because of illness or emergency. <br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Work</span><br>
      Makeup exams will not be given unless an exam is missed for a
      verifiable illness or emergency. <br>
    </p>
    <p>No programming assignment may be turned in more than 2 days late
      (that is,
      if the project is due at 10 pm on Thursday, it cannot be submitted
      after 10 pm the following Saturday). You will have 3 free late
      (slip)
      days in 1 day units (that is, 1 minute to 24 hours late = 1 slip
      day,
      etc.)
      for the projects this semester, but you cannot use slip days for
      the
      first or last programming assignment. You may divide your slip
      days
      across the
      remaining projects in any way you wish to extend deadlines for the
      projects, subject to the 3 day total maximum and the 2 day maximum
      per
      project. To help the TA track your slip-day status, add the
      following
      comment to the header of your file:<br>
    </p>
    <p>Pair Name 1: Slip days used for this project:____&nbsp; Slip days
      used (total):_____<br>
      Pair Name 2: Slip days used for this project:____&nbsp; Slip days
      used
      (total):_____<br>
    </p>
    <p>No other programming assigment extensions will be granted. I
      recommend that you plan to turn in all projects on time and use
      your
      slip days for unexpected illnesses or emergencies. If you are
      working
      with a pair partner on a project, you both use one slip day for
      each
      day your program is late. </p>
    <p><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pair Programming</span><br>
      Unless you have extenuating circumstances, all projects should be
      done
      in pairs. Research has shown that students
      perform and learn better when pair programming is used to complete
      assignments. For pair programming projects, you and your partner
      must
      sit, design, and program together at least 90% of the time, and
      split
      keyboard time evenly. Each student can work independently for at
      most
      5% of the time. See the webpage on pair programming for more
      information.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Once you choose a partner for a
      particular project, you cannot change partners for that
      assignment. In
      an emergency and with instructor approval (that is, your partner
      drops
      the course, gets sick, won't meet with you to work on the project,
      etc.), you may complete the
      assignment individually.&nbsp; Include in your assignment comments
      your
      former
      partner's name and your email correspondence with the TA and
      instructor.</p>
    You must work with a different partner on each project in CS 337.
    After
    each project is completed, you and your partner will submit a
    feedback
    form concerning your work on the project.
    <p>See the assignments page for more information about the projects.
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Computers and Accounts</span><br>
      You must have a CS unix account.&nbsp; You will use this account
      to
      submit your programming assignments via turnin.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grade Changes</span><br>
      If you are dissatisfied with any grade you receive, you must
      present
      a written complaint to the TA who graded your quiz or project
      (submit
      complaints concerning exams to your discussion section TA). The
      complaint must
      be submitted within one week of the date on which we returned, or
      first
      attempted to
      return, the graded work to you. Your complaint must contain
      supporting
      evidence and arguments which explain why your work was graded
      incorrectly. It is not sufficient to submit a note that says
      "regrade
      question 3", for example. Grade change requests that do not meet
      these
      requirements will not be considered. Note that assigned grades are
      not
      the starting point of a negotiation. This isn't a weekend bazaar.
      Unless we have made a mistake in grading your work (i.e., you have
      a
      correct answer that was marked wrong, or your score was added
      incorrectly), your grade is final. </p>
    <p>Note that none of the following grade discussions is appropriate:
      <br>
      (1) "I know my answer was wrong, but I deserve more partial credit
      points." When we grade, we make decisions about how many points to
      give
      for various kinds of wrong answers. This is never a clear cut
      decision.
      The important thing is that we make some decision and then
      implement it
      fairly for everyone. It is completely unfair to come back later
      and
      give
      one person more points just because they ask. We won't do it.
      <br>
      (2) "I don't like my final grade. It will ruin my life for the
      following
      reason: ... Therefore you should give me a better one." Class
      grades
      reflect
      only one thing: how well you did in the class. Life circumstances
      just
      don't play a role here. Don't come to me with this kind of
      argument.
      <br>
      (3) "I don't like my final grade. I am desperate. Isn't there some
      sort of extra credit thing I could do?" Any answer other than "No"
      to
      this
      question would be completely unfair to other students in the class
      unless
      they were all offered this option. That would be equivalent to
      saying
      that
      the semester isn't over and everyone can keep trying. We're not
      going
      to
      do this. Final grades are final.
      <br>
      (4) "I don't like my final grade. Can I have an incomplete and try
      again?" There are University rules for giving incompletes. If you
      meet
      those rules (e.g., you had a medical problem during the semester),
      then,
      of course, come and tell me and ask for an incomplete. But make
      sure
      you
      do it as soon as you can. Do not wait until the semester is over.
      If
      you
      do not meet the rules, the answer is "No".
      <br>
      (5) "I don't like my final grade. It doesn't reflect what I really
      know. I guess I didn't show what I know on the exams, but won't
      you
      give
      me a chance to convince you that I really know this stuff." Again,
      any
      answer other than "No" would be unfair to everyone else.
    </p>
    <p><b>Academic Honesty and Inappropriate Collaboration<br>
      </b>Unless otherwise specified by the instructor, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">you are required to do homework
        assignments
        and quizzes individually, and you and your programming partner
        are
        expected to complete all projects alone</span>. You are
      permitted to
      discuss high-level approaches to the assignments
      with other students, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
        moment
        you start looking at another&nbsp;pair's source code or another
        student's homework solution you have
        crossed the
        line into cheating</span>.&nbsp; I will use <a
        href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eaiken/moss/">plagiarism
        detection
        software</a> on programming assignments to find students who
      have
      copied
      code
      from one another.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examples of cheating
        are</span>:
      looking
      at
      another
      pair's
      program,
      writing
      your
      program
      while
      talking
      to
      someone
      else about it, talking another student through the solution
      code, allowing others to look at your solution code,&nbsp;
      obtaining
      code from a student who took CS 337 during a previous semester,
      and
      looking
      on the internet for code to solve your programming assignments. If
      you
      have any doubts about what is allowed, ask the instructor. <br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note about programming projects:</span>
      We run MOSS on each assignment, and we <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">include projects that were
        submitted during previous semesters of this class.</span>
      Please make sure that you carefully read the pair programming
      rules. If
      your partner writes large parts of the program alone, then you are
      submitting code as your own that you did not write, and this is
      academic dishonesty for both you and your partner. <br>
      <br>
      Part of academic honesty on the programming assignments is
      following
      the pair programming rules. You are NOT allowed to divide the work
      on
      the project in half, with you and your partner each doing parts of
      the
      assignment separately. That is cheating, since you did not
      contribute
      to half of the assignment. You are responsible for the entire
      project
      that you and your partner submit. Make sure that you have
      electronic
      copies of the project, with regular updated versions, even if you
      use
      your partner's machine while coding. All communication with your
      programming partner should be done via email, so that you have a
      log of
      your communication if there are problems. Talk to the
      instructional
      staff immediately if you are having difficulties with your
      partner. If
      you and your partner submit work that you did not contribute to
      writing, you will receive an F in the class.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We follow the University's standard policies on academic honesty.
      They
      will be rigorously enforced. Cheating will result in action
      commensurate
      with the policies stated in the University's Manual on Academic
      Honesty.
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">My penalty
        for
        cheating on an exam, quiz or assignment is an F in the
        course and a referral to the Dean of Students office.</span>
      You are expected to do all project work with your partner only
      unless
      explicit permission
      for group work is given. <br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Religious Holy Days</span><br>
      A student who is absent from an examination or cannot meet an
      assignment deadline due to the observance of a religious holy day
      may
      take the exam on an alternate day or submit the assignment up to
      24
      hours late without penalty, if proper notice of the planned
      absence has
      been given. Notice must be given at least 14 days prior to the
      classes
      which will be missed. For religious holy days that fall within the
      first 2 weeks of the semester, notice should be given on the first
      day
      of the semester. Notice must be personally delivered to the
      instructor
      and signed and dated by the instructor, or sent certified mail.
      Email
      notification will be accepted if received, but a student
      submitting
      email notification must receive email confirmation from the
      instructor.
