<h4 align=center>Fall 2013</h4>
</align>
<h2>Basic Information</h2>
<p>
Welcome!  This course is an introduction to computer systems
software---low-level software abstractions with an emphasis on the
connection of these abstractions to underlying computer hardware. Key
abstractions include threads, dynamic memory allocation, protection,
and I/O.
<p>
There are three interrelated goals for this course. The first goal is
to understand how operating systems and, more generally, computers
work. Students graduating with CS degrees should believe "there is no
magic": they should be able to describe the chain of events that
occurs when they hit a key and cause a letter to appear on the screen
from the register level (or logical gate level or transistor level) to
the system architecture level to the operating system level to the
application level. This is philosophically important, but it is also
of practical interest to developers who need to figure out how to make
a system do what they want it to do.
<p>
The second goal is for you to learn the core ideas in operating
systems: virtual addressing, memory protection, concurrent
programming, file systems, scheduling, transactions, etc. Often, but
not always, such ideas are best explained as abstractions that some
software layer (usually the operating system) provides above imperfect
hardware to make that hardware usable by programmers and users. The
intent is for you to understand such abstractions well enough to be
able to synthesize new abstractions when faced with new problems.
<p>
Many of the ideas and abstractions that we will cover are relevant not
only to OS kernels but also to many large-scale systems. Thus, a third
goal of this course is to enhance your ability to understand, design,
use, and implement such systems.
<p>
<p>
During this course, you will have an opportunity to learn a lot of
practical information about how programming languages, operating
systems, and architectures interact and how to use each effectively.
The written and programming assignments are designed build on and
enhance the lectures.  You will hear the concepts in lecture, read
them in the book, analyze them in the written homework, and put them
in practice in the programming assignments.

  EID in the past, <b>you must re-register for this semester</b>.
<p>
<b>Communication:</b>
<p>
<u>Discussion</u>: The class discussion board is on Piazza.  You may
sign up at this
link: <a href="http://piazza.com/utexas/fall2013/cs439n">http://piazza.com/utexas/fall2013/cs439n</a>.  (Note that the course is listed as "CS439N".)
<p>
I will post course-related announcements and information on the board.
You must read the discussion board, and you should post course-related
questions and responses there.  I expect you to make good use of the
discussion group and of TA and proctor support when you have technical
or administrative questions or problems.
<p>
You are responsible for any and all information posted to Piazza by
any of the course staff.
<p>
<u>Email to you</u>: In this course, email will be used as a means of
communication with students.  You are responsible for checking your CS
email regularly for class work and announcements.  Your CS address may
be forwarded to another account
(see <a href="http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/udb/update/">http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/udb/update/</a>).
<p>
<u>Email to the Instructor or TAs</u>: Emails to me, the TAs, and the
proctors should begin with "CS439:" in the subject line, followed by a
brief description of the purpose of your email.  If you follow this
rule we will be better able to address your questions in a timely
manner.


<h2> Expectations </h2>
<p>
<u>Course Structure</u>: Lectures will introduce systems concepts
through description and examples.  A key component of this course is
the active participation of students.  While I will lead you through
the main concepts and provide you with details relevant for
understanding and applying those concepts, you have to provide the
"active learning" component.  By active learning, I mean you must do
things, think about things, ask questions---basically whatever it
takes for you to be engaged.  The format is informal; questions are
welcome all the time.
<p>
<u>Assignment/Lecture Schedule</u>: A schedule of lecture topics,
reading assignments, and assignment distribution and due dates
is <a href="schedule.html">available online, via the class web
page</a>.  The schedule page contains links to lecture slides and
assignments. Readings are to be completed <b> before</b> class.
<p>
The schedule is subject to change.
<p>
<u>Required Effort</u>: The workload for this course is heavy.  There
are readings, five projects, ten homeworks, two exams, and a final.
<p>
To maximize your learning, it is essential that you read the text
prior to each class meeting.  The ideas in this course require
thinking about and getting used to, which is possible only with
multiple exposures to the material.  Also, the readings can be
difficult---so be patient.  Finally, the concepts build on each other,
so you must stay current.  Please make up any missed classes on your
own or with help from your colleagues.
<p>
<u>Professionalism</u>:
Professional conduct is built upon the idea of mutual respect.  Such conduct 
entails (but is not necessarily limited to): 
<ul>
<li> <b>Attending class</b>: The class benefits from the attendance
and participation of all students.  Your grade will be affected by
your attendance and participation. </li>
<li> <b>Arriving on time</b>: Please do not hesitate to come to class,
even if you are arriving late.  I would rather you attend some of
class, than miss out altogether.  However, if you must arrive late or
leave early, please be considerate of others---sit near the door and
move about quietly. </li>
<li> <b>Minimizing disruptions</b>: Modern technology permits constant
communication, but I ask that you leave all digital devices off and
out of reach during class unless you are waiting news of an emergency
nature (wife delivering a baby, critically ill relative, etc.).</li>
<li> <b>Focusing on the class</b>: Laptop computers or hand-held
devices are not allowed in class. </li>
<li> <b>Respect</b>: You should act respectfully toward all class
participants. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>
<u>Exams and Final</u>: Exams will cover material from lecture,
assignments, and assigned readings.  The exams will be held in the
evening on Tuesday, 10/1, and Wednesday, 11/6.  
<p>
The final will be cumulative, but it will be more heavily weighted
towards material that has not yet been tested.  It will be on the day
and time scheduled by the registrar.
<p>
<!-- Makeup exams will only be arranged under exceptional conditions.  In
these cases, missing the exam must be arranged at least one week prior
to the exam date.
<p>-->
<u>iClicker Participation</u>: iClicker participation is measured in
your answers to iClicker questions, so bring your iClicker with you to
lecture.
<b>In order to receive iClicker credit for a given day you
MUST:</b><ul>
  <li>register your clicker prior to class AND</li>
  <li>have your clicker with you in working order AND</li>
  <li>answer at least one question during class. </li>
</ul>
<p>
You are required to attend class, and you are responsible for knowing
or learning any material presented in class. If you must miss class,
you are not required to inform the instructor, but you are responsible
for learning any material you missed. The instructor posts detailed
notes for each class on the course web site, but classes are
interactive, so the actual discussion may depart from the notes. The
best way to know what actually happened in a class is to be there and
participate; if you must miss a class, you should study the notes
carefully and perhaps talk to your colleagues about the technical
topics discussed and what points were particularly emphasized.
<p>
<b>Use of laptops, phones, or other digital devices during lecture
results in the forfeiture of iClicker participation points.</b>
<p>
<u>Discussion Section Attendance</u>: Attendance at discussion section
is mandatory, and you must attend the one for which you are
registered.
<p>

<u>Homeworks</u>: There will be approximately ten written homework
assignments during the semester.
<p>
Homework problems assigned on the course website will be turned in
using the turnin program before any discussion sections begin.  
<p>
The first half of the discussion sections will generally focus on
<i>completing an additional homework problem</i> and, afterward,
discussing the homework. It is essential that you work on the problem
sets before the discussion section in which they will be discussed
both to maximize the benefit you get from the discussion and so that
you can contribute to the discussion.
<p>
We will typically grade homeworks on a "OK/Not-OK" basis, where "OK"
means that you made a credible effort to solve the problems (even if
you make a mistake.) We reserve the right to grade for correctness as
well. 
<p>
Homeworks must be turned on time without exception, but the lowest two
homework scores will be dropped.  <i>Failure to attend discussion section
and complete the final homework question results in a loss of credit
for the entire homework.</i>
<p>
<u>Projects</u>: There will be approximately five programming projects
during the semester.  The due date for each project will be clearly
stated. Plan to start early since debugging operating system code can
take arbitrarily large amounts of time.  Additionally, respect
Murphy's rule and plan for your bus to run late, your personal
computer to crash the afternoon of the due date, etc.
<p>
For each group project, your group members will evaluate your
contribution.  If your median rating is an unsatisfactory or less for
3 or more projects, your final course grade will be reduced by a
letter grade. 
<p>
All projects must be submitted using the turnin program. We will not
accept assignments e-mailed to us.  All projects are due just before
midnight (11:59pm) on their due date.  Projects are dated by the
turnin system.
<p>
Projects must be submitted in the correct format and named
correctly.  <b>Projects that do not compile or are named incorrectly
will receive a 0.</b>  We will release a script to help you test that
your code will compile correctly.  Use it.
<p>
<u>Late Policy</u>: You will have 4 slip days in 1 day units (that is,
1 minute to 24 hours late = 1 slip day, etc.) to use throughout the
semester to extend project deadlines. However, you may only use two
slip days on any particular project.  Other than that, you may divide
your slip days across the projects in any way you wish, subject to the
4 day total and the 2 day per project maximum.  Slip days are to
account for life circumstances and emergencies.  Do not use your slip
days frivolously.  If you use all your slip days and then cannot turn
in your project on time <b>for any reason</b> then you will receive a
0 for that project.
<p>
<u>Grading</u>: Grades are essential to insuring that your degree has the
value that it deserves.  As a result, we have a grading system that
has two essential properties:
<ul>
<li>It is fair to everyone in the class.</li>
<li>It is a true measure of how much each student knows the class
material.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These class components are used to determine your final average in the
following manner:

       </tr>
     </table>
<p>
The course will be graded on a curve, with the score-to-letter-grade
mapping determined by the instructor based on factors such as the
difficulty of an assignment, the types of errors people are making,
etc. During the semester, I will give rough estimates of where grade
cut-offs lie, but these will be deliberately somewhat vague; if
knowing where a cut-off is within a few points will affect how you
study, you're worrying too much about grades and not enough about the
material (Plus, it's a really bad idea to gauge your effort by what
you think you need to make to get a particular letter grade). I want
everyone in the class to do well, and if everyone masters the material
and gets good marks, I will happily abandon the curve and give "extra"
A's and B's. In particular, I guarantee that anyone who gets a grade
of 90% or more of the total points will get an A, anyone with 80% or
more will get at least a B, and anyone with 70% or more of the points
will get at least a C.
<p>
I grade on a curve rather than an absolute scale because it protects
students from stressing out if I happen to give an overly hard exam
or final. The downside of grading on a curve is that it tends to lead
students to think they are competing against each other. In practice,
this worry is misplaced. First, I will set grade cut-offs for each
assignment to correspond to the quality of the work and depth of
understanding reflected by each range of scores and not by the number
of students that make each range of scores. Second, note that the
impact of any individual score on the overall class distribution is
trivial -- for example someone making a 10% better grade on a exam
raises the class semester average by .1%.
<p>
Also, for these types of projects students often stress about whether
they will be penalized because their project may not be as elaborate
as that of some of the other groups in the class. Again, this is not
something to worry about. The projects are hard enough without looking
over your shoulder at other students. By and large, most students do
quite well on the projects---the consequence is that the projects have
less effect than you might think on the curve. A warning, however: if
you punt the projects, you will fail the course.
<p>
Your grades are recorded in the gradebook on Canvas.
<p>
If you have questions or concerns about your grade, contact your TA
during office hours or by email.
<p>
 
<u>Grade Changes</u>: If you believe your work was graded incorrectly,
you may submit a written or email complaint to the grader.  The
complaint must be submitted <i>within one week</i> of the date on
which we first attempted to return the graded work to you. Your
complaint must contain supporting evidence and arguments which explain
why your work was graded incorrectly. (For example, it is not
sufficient to submit a note that says "regrade question 3".)  Grade
change requests that do not meet these requirements will not be
considered. Note that assigned grades are not the starting point of a
negotiation. This isn't a weekend bazaar---unless we have made a
mistake in grading your work (i.e., you have a correct answer that was
marked wrong, or your score was added incorrectly), your grade is
final.

<p>Note that none of the following grade discussions is appropriate:

<ul>
<li> <i>"I know my answer was wrong, but I deserve more partial credit
points."</i><br> When we grade, we make decisions about how many points to
give for various kinds of wrong answers. This is never a clear cut
decision.  The important thing is that we make some decision and then
implement it fairly for everyone. It is completely unfair to come back
later and give one person more points just because they ask. We won't
do it.
</li>
<br>
<li> <i>"I don't like my final grade. It will ruin my life for the
following reason: ... Therefore you should give me a better one."</i>
<br>Class grades reflect only one thing: how well you did in the
class. Life circumstances just don't play a role here. Don't come to
me with this kind of argument.
</li>
<br>
<li> <i>"I don't like my final grade. I am desperate. Isn't there some
sort of extra credit thing I could do?"</i> <br>Any answer other than "No" to
this question would be completely unfair to other students in the
class unless they were all offered this option. That would be
equivalent to saying that the semester isn't over and everyone can
keep trying. We're not going to do this. Final grades are final.
</li>
<br>
<li> <i>"I don't like my final grade. Can I have an incomplete and try
again?"</i> <br>There are University rules for giving incompletes. If you meet
those rules (e.g., you had a medical problem during the semester),
then, of course, come and tell me and ask for an incomplete. But make
sure you do it as soon as you can. Do not wait until the semester is
over. If you do not meet the rules, the answer is "No".
</li>
<br>
<li> <i>"I don't like my final grade. It doesn't reflect what I really
know. I guess I didn't show what I know on the exams, but won't you
give me a chance to convince you that I really know this stuff."</i>
<br>Again, any answer other than "No" would be unfair to everyone else.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<u>Pair and Group Programming</u>: On most or all of the projects (as
specified in the project description) you must work with at least one
other person.  You must follow the pair programming guidelines below
and on the course web page.  All students will receive the same grade
for the project. Unless group or pair programming is specifically
allowed, all assignments must be done alone---including all homeworks.
<p>
We use <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair
programming</A> because it is a more effective and time efficient way
to learn the material. Researchers have shown that students perform
better in the class in which they use pair programming than without,
and also they perform better in subsequent classes with or without it.
These results indicate that you learn more and better with pair
programming.  Please read:

<ul>
<li>
 <A HREF="kindergarten.pdf">All I need to know about pair programming
I learned in kindergarten</A>, L. A. Williams and
R. R. Kessler, <i>Communications of the ACM</i>, 43(5): 108--114, May
2000.
<p><li>
 <A HREF="pair-hcs-2006.pdf">Pair programming productivity:

K. C.C. Chan, <i>International Journal on Human-Computer Studies</i>,
64: 915--925, June 2006.
</ul>
<p> You must follow the pair programming guidelines: the pair must
sit, design, and program together at least 80% of the time, and split
keyboard time evenly.  Each student can work independently for at most
10% of the effort/time. The person at the keyboard is the driver, and
the person sitting next to him/her is the navigator. We recommend you
alternate driving and navigating every 30 minutes.
<p> For some parts of the course, you will be allowed to change
partners between assignments.  However, once you begin an assignment
with a partner (or a group), you cannot change partners or groups for
that assignment.  If you must stop working with your partner, please
request permission from the instructor and await further instruction.

<h2>Collaboration and Cheating</h2>
<p>
You are encouraged to study for exams,
<b>discuss</b> the homeworks and projects, and discuss debugging
techniques with your colleagues.  You are welcome to use existing
public libraries in your programming assignments (such as public
classes for queues, trees, etc.)  You may also look at operating
systems code for public domain software such as Linux.  Such
activities qualify under approved collaboration practices and you are
welcome to take advantage of them. <b>You may not look at any course
project material relating to any project similar to this course's
class projects.</b> For example, you may not look at the work done by
a student in past years' courses, and you may not look at similar
course projects at other universities.  If you are unsure about
whether a particular source of external information is permitted,
contact the instructor before looking at it.
<p>
Note that cooperation is not the same thing as cheating.  The project,
homeworks, and exams must be the work of the student turning them in.
Materials from the web should only be used for educational
purposes. For example, you can read about threads and look at examples
of thread code, but you must not copy any code from the web or be
looking at any of this code from the web when writing anything you
turn in. If you discuss an assignment with another student or look at
examples from the web, you should employ the following technique:
after a discussion with another student or looking at example code you
should do something that has nothing to do with computer science or
programming for at least half an hour before resuming programming.
<p>
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of
failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Because
such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity
of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced.  <b>The penalty for cheating on an exam, quiz, or assignment
in this course is an F in the course and a referral to the Dean of
Students office.</b>

<p> It is generally okay to verbally discuss the concepts needed to do
projects or homeworks. Three guidelines will help you keep on the
right side of the line.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
   First, other than the TA and instructor, it is never okay to
   look at the written work of another person or show another person
   your written work until after all grading on an assignment is
   completed. This includes looking at paper print-outs, sketching
   solutions on a white board or napkin, or looking at a screen to
   help debugging. <b>The moment you start looking at another
   student's (or pair's) source code you have crossed the line into
   cheating</b>. It should go without saying that copying other
   people's code or solution sets is strictly prohibited.
</li>
<li> Second, while you are discussing an assignment with another
  student, you must not have a writing implement, keyboard, or
  recording device in hand. Similarly, you should not read from your
  own work. After discussing a problem with another student (or the
  TA!), go watch American Idol for a half hour before going back to
  work on the assignment. If you can't remember what the person said
  after a half hour, you didn't really understand it.
</li>
<li>
   Third, everyone in the class is expected to take appropriate
   measures for protecting one's work. For example, you should protect
   your files and printouts from unauthorized access.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that these guidelines are necessarily generalizations and cannot
account for all circumstances. Intellectual dishonesty can end your
career, and it is your responsibility to stay on the right side of the
line.

<p>Examples of cheating include: looking at someone else's program,
writing your program while talking to someone else about it, talking
another student through the solution code, allowing others to look at
your solution code, and looking on the internet for code to solve your
programming assignments.  If you have any doubts about what is
allowed, ask the instructor.
<p>
<a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eaiken/moss/">Plagiarism
detection software</a> will be used on various assignments to find
students who have copied code from one another. Any program that you
submit must be yours, and yours alone.
<p>
If you are participating in a pair or group programming assignment and
your partner cheats, you are also culpable. Either you were following
the rules of pair programming and you knew your partner(s) was
cheating, or you were not following the rules of pair programming and
you turned in work as yours that was not.
<p>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<p>
<u>Religious Holy Days</u>: A student who is absent from an
examination or cannot meet an assignment deadline due to the
observance of a religious holy day may take the exam on an alternate
day or submit the assignment up to 24 hours late without penalty, if
proper notice of the planned absence has been given. Notice must be
given at least 14 days prior to the classes which will be missed. For
religious holy days that fall within the first 2 weeks of the
semester, notice should be given on the first day of the
semester. Notice must be personally delivered to the instructor and
signed and dated by the instructor, or sent certified mail. Email
notification will be accepted if received, but a student submitting
email notification must receive email confirmation from the
instructor.
<p>
<u>Students with Disabilities</u>: The University of Texas at Austin
provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.  Students
requesting accommodations for disabilities must notify the instructor
by the 12th class day.
<p>

<p>
This syllabus is a plan of action for the semester.  It is NOT a
contract and is subject to change.  As the instructor, I reserve the
right to make additions, deletions and modifications to the syllabus
and the course requirements with reasonable notification to the
students enrolled in the course.  You are responsible for any changes
announced in class or on the course website.
