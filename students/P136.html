<ul>

<li> Projects should be completed <i>independently</i> by each student.  
No collaboration beyond general discussion of the project requirements is
permitted.

<li> Projects are due 30 minutes before the start of class on the due date.  Be
sure to hand in assignments on time, late penalties are a loss of a percentage
of the original overall points for the assignment: 1 Day: 15%, 2 Days: 40%; 3
Days: 75%; past 3 days: 100%.  A day is a 24 hour period starting 30 minutes
before the beginning of class and includes all weekend days and holidays.

<li> Submit all code to the TA electronically using <a
href="turnin.html">turnin</a>.  Submit a directory with all code and
supporting documents.

<li>   The submission directory should include the following:

<ol>

<li> All new or modified java code.  Ideally, your solution should be
	    contained within the classes you wrote and does not modify
	    the IR package.   The code
	    should also be properly commented using Javadoc convention.

<br>
<li> A short document (1-2 pages) clearly describing in well-written
English prose, the approach taken to the assignment, the general algorithm
employed, clear instructions on running the system, and insightful
discussion of any experimental results obtained. This document should be
called "REPORT"  and may be HTML or PDF (with an appropriate
file name extension, e.g. "REPORT.html")

<li>  An ASCII file called <b>soln-trace</b> which is a detailed trace of 
your
program running on any sample test problems. The traces can be generated
using the Unix command <b>script</b> (call "man script" for documentation).
To use script to collect traces, do the following:

  <ol>
        <li>
        Type "script soln-trace" at the command line.
        <li>
        Run the program on different test cases, as you would have
                normally done.
        <li>
        When you want to stop collecting traces, type "Control-D" at
                the prompt.
        <li>
        The trace of your run is stored in the local file "soln-trace".
  </ol>

The script command captures <i>everything</i> printed on the
terminal, including non-printing characters like carriage returns
(<tt>^M</tt>) and backspaces (<tt>^H</tt>).  So when you edit the trace
with a text editor, it may look funny.  <b>If the extra control characters
do not affect readability of the trace, then you may submit the trace as
it is.</b>  However, if the trace looks messy, then please re-run your
program and create a new trace. <br>

</ol>

</ul>
