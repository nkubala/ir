<H3>Course Description:</H3> CS429 is the first course in the systems
core sequence required of all UT CS majors.  It describes how
computers operate at a fairly low level of abstraction.  
For example, we'll consider:
<UL>
<li> What are the components of a computer and how do they fit together?
<LI> How do computers do arithmetic?
<li> How does the code you write actually execute?
<li> How does a program in a high level language like C get translated
  into a form the machine can execute?
<li> How can you write code likely to execute efficiently?
<li> How is information stored and accessed?
<li> How does your program access existing "libraries"?
</UL>
<i>Understanding these fundamentals thoroughly is absolutely essential
to your future success in computer science.</i>  The material of this
course is quite detailed and requires careful and diligent study. If
you are not willing to put in the time and effort required to master
this material, you probably should reconsider your decision to major
in Computer Science.<P>

The students that do well in this class are survivors. This class is a
lot of work, and it is important to keep current. The material in this
class is cumulative; it can be quite difficult to catch up if one
falls behind. It is important to keep turning in homework and come to
class.<P>

We will be discussion several different programming languages in this
course: C, x86 assembly language, and Y86 assembly language.  You will
be writing programs in at least C and Y86. <P>

Students are required to attend their assigned lab weekly. <BR><BR>

<!--  Restricted to computer science majors. An introduction to low-level
 computer design ranging from the basics of digital design to the
 hardware/software interface for application programs. Includes basic
 systems principles of pipelining and caching, and requires writing
 and understanding programs at multiple levels. Only one of the
 following may be counted: Computer Science 310, 310H, 429, 429H. -->

<b>Using Piazza:</b> We will be using Piazza for class
communication. The Piazza system is highly catered to getting you help
fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than
emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your
questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the
developers, email team@piazza.com.  The Piazza class page will be
posted shortly.<P>

<!-- 
Find our class page at:
http://www.piazza.com/utexas/summer2012/cs361.
<P>

<H3>Prerequisites:</H3> You are expected to have taken and passed the
following courses (or equivalent) with a grade of at least C-:
Computer Science 311, 311H, 313H, or 313K; Computer Science 314, 314H,
315, or 315H.  If you don't have the prerequisites, be sure to clear
it with the CS department or risk being dropped from the class.<P>

<H3>Text:</H3> The required text book for this class is <i>Computer
Systems, A Programmer's Perspective</i> by Randal E. Bryant and David
O'Hallaron, Prentice Hall, 2010.  You must have this book.  Note that
this book is also used in CS439, so <i>don't sell it back at the end
of the semester</i> if you plan on continuing in CS.<P>

Since we will be programming some in C, I recommend that you have
access to <i>The C Programming Language</i>, second edition, by Brian
Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, Prentice Hall Software Series.  This is
available on-line.  There are also many Web pages devoted to
C-language programming.  A nice tutorial intro to C is here: 
<A HREF="C_tutorial.pdf">C Tutorial</A>.  Java programmers should have
no problem with the subset of C that we will use.<P>

<H3>Class Schedule and Slides:</H3>
The class schedule is here: <A HREF="429schedule.pdf">schedule</A>.
<i>This schedule is approximate; some dates may change slightly.</i><P>

All of the class slides will be made available via links below as we
cover new material.  You are welcome to print them out or view them
on-line.  Slides are in PDF form.  They are derived from slides
developed for the course by Bryant and O'Hallaron and modified by me
and other professors. They are used with permission.<P>

<P>

<H3>Tests:</H3> There will be three in-class exams of approximately
one hour each. See the schedule for dates.  I will drop the lowest of
these three in-class exams.  There will also be a three-hour final
exam on Wednesday, December 11, from 7-10pm, in ART 1.102. That's the
day and time determined by the registrar for a class in our time slot.
Please don't make travel plans that will conflict with the final exam.
<P>

<H3>Assignments:</H3> Written homework will be assigned each week.  It
must be submitted to your TA by the end of your discussion section, and
will not be accepted late.  You may work together on written
assignments.  This is an easy 15% of your grade so make the most of
it.<P>

You will have 7 labs over the course of the semester.  <i>You must
work alone on all labs.</i>  The due dates will be clearly marked.
For labs, you will have 3 total grace days available which you can use
over the course of the semester.  You'd be advised to save them as
long as possible to deal with illnesses and personal emergencies. <P>

<H3>Attendance:</H3> You are encouraged to come to class, but

<H3>Computation of Your Grade:</H3>
The weighting of the grades for the various aspects of the course are
as follows: 
<BR><BR> 

<table border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=5>
  <tr valight="top">
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Component</i></td>
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Percent</i></td>
  </tr>
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">In class exams (one dropped) <TH>30%
  <TR> <TH align="left" ALIGN="Left">Final Exam <TH>20%
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Homework <TH>15%
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Labs  <TH>35%
</TABLE><BR> 


<!-- The weighting for the laboratory assignments will be as follows:
<table border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=5>
  <tr valight="top">
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Component</i></td>
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Percent</i></td>
  </tr>
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Lab 0:<TH>3%
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Lab 1:<TH>7%
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Lab 2a:<TH>6%
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Lab 2b:<TH>5%
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">Lab 3:<TH>4%
</TABLE><BR> -->

It is very important that you do the laboratory assignments. Once a
laboratory has been turned in, material concerning a laboratory may
appear on an exam.<P>

Grades for the entire course are averaged using the weighting below:
<BR><BR> 

<table border=1 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=5>
  <tr valight="top">
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Course score</i></td>
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><I>Grade</i></td>
  </tr>
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[90...100]<th>A
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[87... 90)<th>A-
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[85... 87)<th>B+
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[80... 85)<th>B
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[77... 80)<th>B-
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[75... 77)<th>C+
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[70... 75)<th>C
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[67... 70)<th>C-
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[65... 67)<th>D+
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[60... 65)<th>D
  <TR> <TH ALIGN="Left">[ 0... 60)<th>F
</table>
<P>
This is tentative.  The grades likely will be curved and may be a bit
more generous than this.  They will certainly not be less
generous. <P>

<!-- Note the interval marks around the course score column. For example, a
course grade of B will be assigned if your semester grade is greater
than or equal to 80 and less than 85. This also means that a course
grade of at least 67 needs to be achieved for this course to count
toward a UTCS degree. <P> -->

<H3>Scholastic Dishonesty:</H3> Academic dishonesty will not be
tolerated.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct</A>
for an excellent summary of expectations of a student in a CS
class.<P>

All work must be the student's own effort.  <I>Work by students in
previous semesters is not your own effort.  Don't even think about
turning in such work as your own, or even using it as a basis for your
work.  We have very sophisticated tools to find such cheating and we
use them routinely.</I> It's far better to get a 0 on an assignment
than to cheat.<P>

No deviation from the standards of scholastic honesty or professional
integrity will be tolerated.  Scholastic dishonesty is a serious
violation of UT policy; and will likely result in an automatic F in
the course and may result in further penalties imposed by the
department or by the university.  Don't do it.  If you are caught, you
will regret it.  And even if you're not caught, you're still a
cheater.<P>

<H3>Students with Disabilities:</H3> 

Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259,
