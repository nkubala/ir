  <dt><h3>Course Objectives</h3>
  <dd>
    <p>Perl is a programming language that combines the modern
    robustness of Java with the expedient pragmatism of scripting
    languages.  It offers both the low-level system access of C and
    the high-level elegance of Lisp.  One of its mottoes is,
    &ldquo;There&rsquo;s More Than One Way To Do It.&rdquo; Its
    flexibility makes Perl a powerful tool, but its permissiveness can
    lead to incomprehensible code or mysterious bugs.</p>

    <p>This course provides a brief introduction to the language for
    students who want to add Perl to their toolbox.  It assumes
    familiarity with the fundamental elements of computer programming,
    but no prior experience with Perl or any other particular language
    is necessary.  Brief weekly assignments will give students
    hands-on experience writing, debugging, and revising Perl
    programs.  A final project will exercise students' ability to
    develop a slightly more involved program, integrating concepts
    familiar from the weekly assignments.</p>

  <dt><h3>Textbook</h3>
  <dd>
    <p>No textbook is required.  All assignments should be possible to
    complete using only the lecture notes and the 
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.2/">Perl documentation</a> that it 
    specifically mentions. <i>The <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.2/perl.html"> perl man page</a> is a great place to start.</i></p>

    <p>However, to get the most out of this course and Perl itself, a 
    book is a great investment.  A very good (and free on the web in PDF)
    resource is chromatic's <a href="http://www.onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/modern_perl_letter.pdf">Modern Perl</a>.
    After this course is over and you still like and/or want to use Perl, 
    I highly recommend <i>Effective Perl Programming</i> by Joseph N. Hall,
    <i>et al.</i> as well as books by Damian Conway and Mark Jason Dominus.</p>

    <p><i>If you find yourself wanting more examples or explanations, I 
    highly recommend purchasing a book!</i></p>

  <dt><h3>Lectures</h3>
  <dd>CS 105 Perl uses a &ldquo;flipped classroom&rdquo; model.
    Lectures are provided via videos posted to Blackboard and the class
    meeting functions similarly to a discussion section.  Further
    explanations and clarifications are given in class in addition to
    quizzes.  Students are encouraged to attend every class meeting; poor
    performance and poor attendance are highly correlated.  The lecture
    slides used in the videos are also posted to Blackboard.  Assignments
    will be announced in class but not through Blackboard, unless you
    configure Blackboard to send notifications about new assignments.
    
  <dt><h3>Office Hours</h3>
  <dd>Office hours will be held as listed above, at
    <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/gdc.html"
    >GDC</a> 5.434 (north wing aka Dell Hall, east end),
    unless otherwise announced in class.  If you are unable to attend the
    usual office hours, email me to set up a meeting.  I am also happy
    to <a href= "http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2001-08-26/">thwart a
    meeting</a> by answering your question via email.

  <dt><h3>Homework</h3>
  <dd>Seven weekly homeworks will be assigned, typically in Wednesday classes 
    and due the following Wednesday.  All homeworks are due at 12:00 noon 
    (one hour before classtime) on the due date.
    Homework will be submitted using the <tt>turnin</tt> program from a 
    CS account (run <tt>man turnin</tt> on a CS machine for more details).
    <b>Do not use the Microlab Turnin web page.</b>
    You need to <a href="https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/udb/newaccount/">get a CS 
    account</a> if you don't yet have one.
    The instructor will run your programs on a CS machine with Perl 5.14.2. 
    I recommend SSH for remote login since your Perl experience will be
    text-centric.

  <dt><h3>Grading</h3>
  <dd>The grading distribution is roughly 50% homeworks, 30% final project,
      and 20% quizzes.
    The quizzes will be unannounced but unsurprising if you pay attention.
    The final project serves as a final exam.
    Note that it will be due after the class stops
    meeting on October 21, but you can still make an appointment for 
    office hours until that date. Grades will be posted on 
    <a href="https://courses.utexas.edu/">Blackboard</a>.
    The instructor reserves the right to use attendance and class participation
    to improve your final letter grade if you are &ldquo;on the fence.&rdquo;
    Any questions about grades must be submitted in writing (including 
    via e-mail).

  <dt><h3>Class Announcements and Discussion</h3>
  <dd>The instructor will send class announcements through 
    <a href="https://courses.utexas.edu/">Blackboard</a>.<br><br>

    Blackboard also has a Discussion Board so students can help each
    other.  Appropriate discussion topics include questions about Perl
    itself, requests for clarification about anything said in class,
    requests for help with the computing environment, etc. In general, the
    discussion board is for sharing information that may be of interest to
    classmates, but obviously homework solutions are off-limits!  

  <dt><h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
  <dd>See the Computer Science Department's
    <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html">Code 
    of Conduct</a>.
    Students are encouraged to work together to improve their
    understanding of the course material, but for all homework
    assignments, only their own work may be submitted.  University
    policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
