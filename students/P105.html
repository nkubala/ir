      <h3><a name="assignments"></a>Assignments</h3>
      <p>The first assignment is a literature review. Each student must
        choose a paper, and prepare a 15 to 20-minute presentation of
        it. Furthermore, following the references backwards, each
        student must write a paper of maximum 2 pages reconstructing the
        line of work that brought to that paper, summarizing the
        authors' contributions. All papers are due on October 2nd,
        regardless of when the presentation is given. This assignment is
        meant to make the students understand how a research line
        develops, and how to determine what the most influential works
        are in the field they are interested in.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The second assignament is a demonstration on the robot, of an
        implementation halfway through the final project. Specific
        demonstrations have been discussed with each group. Groups must
        also hand in a report of the work up to this demo.<br>
      </p>
      Presentations will be held on Wednesdays every week, and each
      student must book a slot for their presentation on <a
        target="_blank"
        href="http://farnsworth.csres.utexas.edu/bwi/index.php/FRI_Course_2">this




        page</a> of the wiki (log-in required), on a first come first
      served basis. If two weeks before a presentation day some slots
      for that day are still available, I will choose the presenters
      uniformly at random among those who have not booked a slot yet.

          href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7Etodd/cs378/index.html">Spring






          2013 CS378</a>, and you need to have completed at least the
        first two assignment from that class.&nbsp; Good programming
        skills, preferably in C and/or C++. <br>
      </p>
      <p>To do the catch-up assignments please log into the wiki and
        start from the "Start here" page.<br>

      <h2><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000"> Text and Website</a> </h2>
      There is no textbook for this course. Instead, relevant research
      papers will be assigned. <br>
      <br>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2> Wiki </h2>
      <p> The class will also make extensive use of a wiki. Reading
        responses, project updates, and other project information will
        be posted on the class wiki: <a target="_blank"
          href="http://farnsworth.csres.utexas.edu/bwi/index.php/FRI_Course_2">http://farnsworth.csres.utexas.edu/bwi/index.php/FRI_Course_2</a>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2> Philosophy and Goal </h2>
      <p> The foremost goal of this course is to expose the student to
        the full range of activities required of a real-life computer
        science researcher. It turns out that computer scientists rarely
        read textbooks, sit silently in lectures, work on programming
        assignments with correct and complete answers, or take exams.
        Rather, they </p>
      <ul>
        <li>read about and critically assess original research; </li>
        <li>speak in public; </li>
        <li>collaborate effectively with peers; </li>
        <li>devise solutions and/or approaches to open-ended problems;
          and </li>
        <li>write about these solutions and/or approaches. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> This course presents an opportunity for students to help
        decide whether they would enjoy going on to graduate school and
        an eventual career as a computer science researcher. In
        particular, students will be required to read published research
        papers, write brief reactions to them, participate in class
        discussions, propose and execute a solution to a challenging
        open-ended problem, and write about their work. They will be
        given an opportunity to collaborate with other students on the
        final project. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2> Content Overview </h2>
      <p> This course is focused on developing a <i>building wide
          intelligence</i> (BWI) for the new computer science building.
        The idea is to have a pervasive intelligence throughout the
        building, in the form of robots, kiosks, display screens, and
        cameras. These robots will perform a variety of tasks, such as
        leading people to their destinations or locating a person in the
        building. </p>
      <p> The main goal of this course is to complete a small research
        project, advancing the abilities of the current BWI system. </p>
      <p> Participation in the class discussions will also form a
        significant part of the grade. Class meetings will consist of
        discussions based on assigned readings and updates on project
        progress. </p>

      <h2><a name="SECTION000110000000000000000"> Academic Dishonesty
          Policy</a> </h2>
      <p>All work ideas, quotes, and code fragments that originate from
        elsewhere must be cited according to standard academic practice.
        Students caught cheating will automatically fail the course. If
        in doubt, look at the <a

          guidelines</a> and/or ask. </p>

      <h2><a name="SECTION000120000000000000000"> Notice about students
          with disabilities</a> </h2>
      <p> The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request
        appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with
        disabilities. To determine if you qualify, please contact the
        Dean of Students at 471-6529; 471-4641 TTY. If they certify your
        needs, I will work with you to make appropriate arrangements. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2><a name="SECTION000130000000000000000"> Notice about missed
          work due to religious holy days</a> </h2>
      <p> A student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other
        project due to the observance of a religious holy day will be
        given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a
        reasonable time after the absence, provided that he or she has
        properly notified the instructor. It is the policy of the
        University of Texas at Austin that the student must notify the
        instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled
        on dates he or she will be absent to observe a religious holy
        day. For religious holy days that fall within the first two
        weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first
        day of the semester. The student will not be penalized for these
        excused absences, but the instructor may appropriately respond
        if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed
        assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the
        excused absence. </p>
