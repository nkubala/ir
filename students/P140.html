<h2>Project 3 for CS 371R: Information Retrieval and Web Search <br>
Web Spidering and PageRanking<br>
</h2>
Due: Tuesday Nov. 19, 2013<br>
(Making web page: Part 1 due: Nov. 10;&nbsp; Part 2 due: Nov. 12)<br>
</center>
<br>
<h3>Existing Spiders </h3>
<p> As discussed in class, a basic system for
spidering the web is available in <code>/u/mooney/ir-code/ir/webutils/</code>
See the <a href="../doc/ir/webutils/package-summary.html">Javadoc </a>
for this
code. Use the <a
 href="../doc/ir/webutils/Spider.html#main%28java.lang.String%5B%5D%29">
<code>main</code> method </a> for the <a
 href="../doc/ir/webutils/Spider.html">
<code>Spider</code></a> class to start from a particular URL and spider
the web
breadth-first and save the documents in a specified directory for
subsequent
indexing and searching with VSR. Also see the specializations <a
 href="../doc/ir/webutils/SiteSpider.html"> <code>SiteSpider</code></a>
and <a href="../doc/ir/webutils/DirectorySpider.html">
<code>DirectorySpider</code></a>, which restrict their crawling to a
particular
site (host) or directory, respectively.
</p>
<p>See a <a href="../spider-trace.txt">sample trace</a> of running
<code>SiteSpider</code> on the UT CS department faculty page to collect
75 pages related to CS faculty.
</p>
<p>This assignment will not require using the "<code>-safe</code>"
spidering flag
that invokes restrictions according to the
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html">Robot Exclusion
Policy</a> since we will be sticking to spidering within the
department. Therefore
the <code>Safe</code>* and <code>Robot</code>* classes can be ignored
for now. However, if you spider outside the department, be sure to use
"<code>-safe</code>". 
</p>
<p>A collection of 800 department pages <code>SiteSpider</code>ed from <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/faculty">
<code>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/faculty</code></a> are cached in
<code>/u/mooney/ir-code/corpora/cs-faculty/</code>. Like
<code>yahoo-science</code>, this directory can be indexed and searched using
VSR, as in <a href="../proj1/">Project 1</a>. This database can also be
searched using the <a href="../search.html">Simple Search Engine</a> servlet
demo. The code for this servlet is available at
<code>/u/mooney/ir-code/irs/</code> ("irs" is for "information retrieval
servlets").
</p>
<h3>Your Task</h3>
<p>
Your assignment is to make a specialization of the <code>Spider</code>
class called <code>PageRankSpider</code> that computes the PageRanks
of the spidered pages based on their link structure, and make a
specialization of the <code>InvertedIndex </code>class
called <span style="font-family:
monospace;">PageRankInvertedIndex</span> that utilizes the PageRanks
to compute the relevance of documents. Make sure to override only the
methods you change. You should also create further a
specialization <code>PageRankSiteSpider</code> that restricts its
spidering accordingly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>While crawling, <code>PageRankSpider</code> should form a graph
based on the incoming and outgoing links. When computing PageRank, only those pages which are actually
indexed (saved to disk) should be included in the graph as nodes. You may find <code>ir.webutils.Graph</code>
and <code>ir.webutils.Node</code> data structures helpful for building and manipulating the graph. Then it should run the PageRank algorithm on the graph and store all the PageRanks in a text file named <code>pageRanks</code> in the same directory as the crawled pages.  The format of <code>pageRanks</code> should be similar to this example:

<pre class='codesample'>
P001.html 0.006494458532952974
P002.html 0.009569125239295519
P003.html 0.006569776377162855
</pre>

Each line contains a file name, some amount of whitespace, and the computed PageRank for that document.<br><br>

With respect to the PageRank algorithm's parameters, use 0.15 for <em>alpha</em> and 50 for the number of <em>iterations</em>. <br>
</p>
<p>
 You can crawl the following URL to help you verify that your PageRank algorithm works:
 <pre class="codesample"> <a href="a.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mooney/ir-course/proj3/a.html</a> </pre>
</p>
<p><code></code>In addition to indexing the documents, <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code> should read the
 PageRanks of the documents. When computing the relevance of the document for a
 query it should add its PageRank scaled by a <em>weight</em> parameter to the score.  The <em>weight</em> parameter should be a command
 line argument for <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code> specified with "<code>-weight value"</code> </p>


<p><strong>Making Web Pages</strong><br>
</p>
<p>As discussed in class, in order to create test data for this
assignment, everyone
should create a special personal page for this class at
<code>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/<i>login</i>/ir-course.html</code>
by adding an
"<code>ir-course.html</code>" file to the <code>/u/<i>login</i>/public_html/</code>
web
directory for your <code><i>login</i></code>.  You might need to set the Linux permissions to make the file readable with the command <code>chmod a+r ir-course.html</code>.  Make sure that when you click on <a
 href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html">
your link</a> it pulls up your new web page.<br>
</p>
<strong>Important: Parts 1 and 2 of this assignment cannot be turned in late!</strong>  Note: please do not submit your ir-course.html pages through turnin.  Simply post them to the web as described above. 
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 1 (2.5 points): due Nov. 10</span><br>
You should include links to at least 5 webpages
of the courses that you have enjoyed from the list of CS courses
located at <a href="course-list.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moooney/ir-course/proj3/course-list.html</a>.
Please include the links <b>exactly</b> as they are given in this
list, and don't
worry if your favorite class is not included - we are just creating a
toy link
structure. For example, your "<code>ir-course.html</code>" may look
like <a href="favorite.txt">this</a>.<br>
This simple part counts for 2.5% of
the project grade. They all will be linked from <a
 href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html">
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html</a> .<br>
</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 2 (2.5 points): due Nov. 12</span><br>
Once all ir-course.html pages are in place by Nov. 10, select at least
3 <code>ir-course.html</code> pages of other students and link them
from your page. You may use
some criteria like how much you agree with their favorite courses.
Again, the bottom-line is to make an interesting toy link structure.
This part counts  2.5% of the project grade. Do
not change your page after Nov 12.<br>

<p>Use your <code>PageRankSiteSpider</code> to crawl from&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html</a>
and index all
student course pages. A limit of 200 pages should
suffice. Index and search the resulting directory of pages using <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code>
and compare the search results to those obtained
with the original <code>InvertedIndex</code> for several different
values of <span style="font-style: italic;">weight</span>. Try the
following queries:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raymond machine learning</li>
  <li>cryptography</li>
  <li>vision visualization graphics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Report and Trace</h3>
<p>
In your report, describe the PageRank algorithm as you have implemented it, and describe how you changed the retrieval process to incorporate it.  Additionally, try several queries to get a feel for the effects of PageRank and then answer at least these two questions: 
  <ol>
    <li>Does PageRank seem to have an effect on the quality of your results, as compared to the original retrieval code?  Why or why not?</li>  
    <li>How does varying <em>weight</em> change your results?</li>
  </ol>
  
You are asked to submit two separate traces for this assignment: a trace of the spidering operation and a trace of the retrieval operation. 
<p>This is a sample <a href="page-ranks.txt">page rank output file</a>&nbsp; in which <code>PageRankSiteSpider</code> has been
crawled on the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html">students'
pages</a>. </p>
<p>This is a sample <a href="retrieve-trace.txt">retrieval trace</a> from running the <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code> with a couple different weights on the queries above (see also the <a href="pageurls.txt">filename to URL mapping</a> for this trace). 
</p>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>
In submitting your solution, follow the general course instructions on
<a href="../proj-submit-info.html">submitting projects</a> on the
course homepage.  Note that this assignment requires <strong>two</strong> traces, as described below:
</p>
<p>Along with that, follow these specific instructions for Project 3:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create new classes by extending existing classes - call them <code>PageRankSpider</code>, <code>PageRankSiteSpider</code>, and <code>PageRankInvertedIndex</code>.  You may also wish to create a standalone  <code>PageRank</code> class to compute PageRank.</li>
  <li> For this project, submit a directory, which
should contain:
    <ol>
      <li> <i>REPORT.* file</i>: writeup in text or html or ps or pdf </li>
      <li> <i>spider-trace.txt</i>: trace file of running the spider on the sample corpus
</li>
      <li> <i>page-ranks.txt</i>: page rank output file when
crawled on <a
 href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mooney/ir-course/students.html">students'
pages</a></li>
      <li> <i>retrieve-trace.txt</i>: trace file of program execution when
querying with page rank on at least the queries mentioned above.</li>

      <li> <i>ir directory</i>: should contain /webutils , and /vsr
with all (and <i>only</i>) the files that you have created or modified.</li>
      <li>If you make any changes to the existing code (should be
minimal) then also turn in the modified files.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> <b> It is important to submit the correct directory structure!</b>
Executing
"turnin -list jiho cs371r-proj3" after the submission should produce
output similar to the following:
    <pre>pandora.cs.utexas.edu$ turnin -list jiho cs371r-proj3<br>12027712    4 drwx------   3 jiho grad         4096 Nov  6 03:38 ./<br>12027712    4 drwxr-xr--   3 jiho grad         4096 Nov  6 03:38 ./proj3<br>12027723    4 drwxr-xr-x   4 jiho grad         4096 Nov  6 03:37 ./proj3/ir<br>12027724    4 drwxr-xr-x   2 jiho grad         4096 Nov  6 03:37 ./proj3/ir/webutils<br>12027725    2 -rw-r--r--   1 jiho grad         1471 Oct 23 23:36 ./proj3/ir/webutils/PageRankSiteSpider.java<br>12027726    6 -rw-r--r--   1 jiho grad         6076 Nov  6 03:22 ./proj3/ir/webutils/PageRankSpider.java<br>12027727    3 -rw-r--r--   1 jiho grad         2219 Nov  6 03:35 ./proj3/ir/webutils/PageRank.java<br>12027728    4 drwxr-xr-x   2 jiho grad         4096 Nov  6 03:37 ./proj3/ir/vsr<br>12027729    9 -rw-r--r--   1 jiho grad         8347 Nov  6 02:45 ./proj3/ir/vsr/PageRankInvertedIndex.java<br>12027730    6 -rw-r--r--   1 jiho grad         5199 Oct 10 10:05 ./proj3/REPORT.pdf<br>12027731   18 -rw-r--r--   1 jiho grad        18368 Nov  6 03:27 ./proj3/spider-trace<br>12027731   18 -rw-r--r--   1 jiho grad        15323 Nov  6 03:29 ./proj3/retrieve-trace<br></pre>
