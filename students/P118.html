<p>
<B>PREREQUISITES:</B>
The following courses, with a grade of at least C in each: 
CS 310,  CS 336, CS 337 AND M 408D/408M. 
</p>

<p>
This course is a theoretical introduction to cryptography.
The topics we will cover include:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> classical cryptography
<LI> elements of coding and information theory
<LI> modern cryptographic methods:
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> public key cryptosystems
<LI> authentication and digital signatures
<LI> secret sharing schemes
</UL>
</UL>
We will also cover some necessary mathematical background.
</p>

<p>
<B>TEXTBOOK:</B> We will use the book "Introduction to cryptography with 
coding theory" by W. Trappe, and L. C. Washington. (second edition)
The lectures will also cover material that is not in the book, 
therefore class attendance and taking good notes are important.
</p>


<p>
<B>BACKGROUND:</B> The course will involve mathematical reasoning and proofs.
We will cover the necessary mathematics in class, but some
familiarity with the complexity of algorithms and probabilities will 
be assumed. 
</p>
<p>
I recommend reviewing the first 4 chapters of 
"Discrete Mathematics and its Applications" by Kenneth H. Rosen
(textbook for CS336) before taking the course.
This includes a review of the growth of functions (1.8), 
fundamentals of algorithms and basic number theory (chapter 2),
mathematical reasoning and proofs (3.1, 3.2)
and probabilities (4.4, 4.5).
</p>

<p>

will be paper/pencil exercises. <BR>

<p>
<B>Exams:</B>
There will be a background quiz on August 31 in class.
There will be three written tests during the course on <BR>
<B>September 21, October 21
and December 2 </B> in class. (No final exam.)
