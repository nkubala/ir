<dt><b>Description:</b></dt> 
<dd> 
  <p>
This 3 credit-hour course is a continuation of <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joel/cs378">CS378 Computational
Intelligence in Game Research I.</a> Based on the proposal developed in
CS378I, the students will carry out an independent research project.
The general goal is to gain immersive experience in computer science research
</p><p><b>Grades</b> will be based on your effort and progress on your project. Note that grades do not depend on whether
the project is successful, but upon attending regular advisory meetings,
demonstrating consistent effort, and overcoming research obstacles. There is no curve or competition in this class, it is possible for <b>everyone</b> to get an A if they
expend significant effort working on their projects and clearly present their results.</p>

<p>There will be
three equally-weighted components to the final grade:
<dl>
<dt>
Project meetings during the semester:</dt><dd>You will meet regularly with myself and the mentors. During these meetings, we'll discuss progress and potential next steps. The mentors and I will evaluate this part of the grade by looking at progress throughout the semester and estimating effort and ability to overcome research obstacles.</dd>
<dt>
Interactive project presentation:</dt><dd>Near the end of the semester each student or group will present what they've been working on and what they've learned. Presentations will be graded on clarity and content.</dd>
<dt>Written report at the
  end of the semester:</dt>
<dd>Each group will be responsible for a report that summarizes their project -- what worked, what didn't, any possible insights or conclusions from the research, and ideas for further extensions. Grades will be given to reports for
clear presentation of ideas and depth of discussion.</dd>
</dl>
</p><p>
 The <a href="http://piazza.com/utexas/fall2013/cs378/home">Piazza group</a> (piazza.com/utexas/fall2013/cs378/home) for the class will be the main means of communication.
</p><p>
We will meet the first day of
class in the scheduled room to discuss the class's structure. Weekly research group meetings will be held to discuss and present research papers and current research progress. Importantly, each group is expected
  to regularly sign up and meet with the instructor and/or mentors outside of the weekly research group meetings.
  Watch the Piazza site for
  further announcements. Suggestions are welcome.
